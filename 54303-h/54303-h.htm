<span class="smaller">SOUTHBOURNE.</span></h2>

</div>


<p>In a period of English history which graybeards call
the good old times&mdash;the fine old times; that is to say,
when Parliament was horribly corrupt, and the Poor
Laws as barbarous as the Inquisition; when it took
fifteen hours to go from London to Dover; and when at
least one-half of the conveniences which we now very
reasonably call the necessities of life had no existence&mdash;Southbourne
was a small straggling village, and, by
reason of the quaint and primitive aspect of its houses,
something, even in those good old times, like an
anachronism on the face of the land. What is now a
well-looking street, fairly paved, and decorated with a
number of showy shop-windows, was then an uneven
road, with great spaces of grassy land, dusty and closely
nibbled by goats, between the houses; whilst the houses
themselves were mostly gable-roofed, with latticed windows,
which served excellently to exclude the light, and
which gave a blank and lack-lustre look to the edifices,
as though they were weary to death of the view over
the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet, in spite of its architectural deformities, Southbourne
was such a place as would weave its homely
interests about a man’s heart, and be present to his
mind when gay and splendid scenes were forgotten. At
the very entrance of the village, as you went into the
street out of the dusty London Road, stood the King’s
Arms Inn, a long, low-built, white-faced tavern, with a
great sign-board hung flagwise over the doorway, which,
when the wind was fresh, would swing with hoarse outcries,
as though urging the distant wayfarer to make
haste and enjoy the welcome that was to be obtained,
for a few pence, from the stout, well-fed host who presided
within. Opposite this tavern stood a decent farmhouse,
its thatched roof black with time, begirt with
walls and palings, within which, when the harvest moon
was high, great stacks of hay would rear their gold-coloured
sides, and make the air as sweet as the smell of
new milk. And all about this pleasant farmhouse were
apple and cherry trees, under whose shadows a vast
family of cocks and hens held the day eternally busy
with their voices; while pigs in unseen sties grunted
their hungry discord, and did their lazy best to drown
the mournful cooing of doves in wicker cages, and the
cheerful notes of the birds, who were attracted in countless
numbers to the farmyard.</p>

<p>Between these two houses ran what the villagers
called the High Street; and the eye followed the road,
patched here and there with dark-coloured grass, for
nearly a third of a mile, noting the gable-roofed houses
that looked at each other from either side; the blacksmith’s
shed, where the bellows were always roaring;
the flat-roofed baker’s shop, standing importunately
forwards, away from the little house in which the baker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
lived; the butcher’s hard by; the apothecary’s next to
that; and the linendraper’s shop, which had absorbed
the frontage of no less than two solemn-looking houses&mdash;noting
these and other details contributing to the
carnal or frivolous interests of the place, until it settled
upon a small building, which, standing in the centre of
the road, narrowed it into a large and a small lane, and
thus marked the extent and importance of the High
Street.</p>

<p>Our story opens on a summer’s evening. The daylight
is still abroad upon the distant hill-tops, but the
twilight has fallen like an inaudible hush upon Southbourne,
and the farmyards are tranquil, save when, now
and again, some uncomfortable hen seeking a resting-place
near to her sovereign cock hops for his perch, but
in hopping falls and awakens the sleepers with her
fluttering scrambles and keen notes of distress, echoed
by a hundred wondering throats.</p>

<p>The evening is warm, and many of the house doors
are open; and at these open doors sit, here and there,
men in their shirt-sleeves, or in homely smocks, smoking
long pipes, and addressing each other from across the
road with voices bespeaking laborious thought, which
demands many reflective puffs to clarify and adjust.
Now the apothecary’s boy comes out and lights the
coloured lamp over the door, while the apothecary within
sets two wax candles against his brilliant globes of lustrous
dyes and illuminates the darksome roadway with
a crimson and a yellow gleam. Now the linendraper’s
assistant steps forth and puts up the shutters to his
master’s windows, whilst the master himself struts along
the floor, flapping his counter with a dust-brush, and
inhaling the appetising perfume which streams from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
inner room, and which is the best assurance he could
demand that his supper is preparing. Anon comes a
lame man, armed with a ladder, a lanthorn, and a can
of oil at his girdle; he sets the ladder against a lamp-post,
and in five minutes’ time succeeds in kindling a
faint uncertain light in the darkling air. Thrice does
he perform this laborious duty, and then, lo! the High
Street is illuminated.</p>

<p>These lights seem to act as signals for sundry groups
of gossips, standing here and there along the dusty road,
to disperse. The small cackle of talk, like the click of
wheels driven against springs, ceases; the old hobble
towards the houses, the young follow yet more leisurely;
the gloom deepens; one by one the doors are closed
and little yellow lights twinkle mistily upon the latticed
windows. And now, though the clock of St. George’s
Church has not yet tolled the half-hour past eight, one
may easily see that the good village of Southbourne,
with one eye upon the candles, costly at sixteenpence
the pound, and another eye upon the early hour that is
to expel it from its slumbers into the fields and the workshops,
is making what haste it can to creep with heavy
eyelids into bed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the house that looks askant down the road and
breaks the thoroughfare into lanes, there is a sorrow at
work that should seem absolutely inconsistent with the
serenity and peace of the summer evening outside.</p>

<p>Three persons are seated in a cosy room; a tall lamp
on a table sheds a soft light upon the walls; the window
is open, and the large tremulous stars look in through
the branches of the elms which front the little building.
How sweet is the smell of the clematis about the win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>dow!
and see, a great black moth whirrs towards the
lamp and occupies the silence with its vigorous slaps
against the ceiling.</p>

<p>The old woman in the high-backed chair, looking
down upon her placid hands, is a perfect picture of
handsome old age: hair white as snow; a sunken cheek
touched with a hectic that passes well for, if indeed it
be not, the bloom of health; a garrulous under lip; a
mild and benevolent expression. She is dressed in an
antique satin gown, and a fine red silk handkerchief, as
large as a shawl, is pinned about her shoulders.</p>

<p>Facing her sits a young man, broad-shouldered and
bronzed, with large lustrous black eyes and dark wavy
hair. He wears a pilot cloth coat and black trousers,
bell-mouthed at the feet, and a plain silver ring upon
his left hand.</p>

<p>Close beside him, on a low chair, sits a young girl,
with a sweet and modest face, and bright yellow hair
which shines in the lamplight like gold, and blue eyes
filled now with tears.</p>

<p>So they sit, so they have sat, for many minutes in
silence, and nothing is heard but the ticking of the clock
on the mantelpiece, or the awkward moth that hits the
ceiling, or now and again the melancholy plaint of some
dreaming or belated bird from the dark country that
stretches outside like a vision under the throbbing starlight.</p>

<p>Presently the old lady, lifting her head, says:</p>

<p>“I don’t think it pleases God that people’s hearts
should be sorrowful. Nothing should grieve us but
the fear of His anger; and if there be truth in religion,
and any wisdom in human experience, there is nothing
in this world that should make us sad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl presses her hand to her eyes, and answers
in a broken voice:</p>

<p>“John and I have never really been parted before.”</p>

<p>“We never can be parted, Dolly, my sweet little
wife,” says the young man. “There was a fear of parting
before, but none now, dear one. I am only leaving
you for awhile&mdash;and that is not parting, is it, grandmother?
Parting is separation, and those whom God
has joined cannot be parted, cannot be parted, my
Dolly!”</p>

<p>“Ay, that is right!” exclaims the old lady. “John
is only leaving you for awhile&mdash;you cannot be parted&mdash;remember
that.”</p>

<p>“But it is to be a long while, and my heart will be
so lonely without him, granny.”</p>

<p>The old lady gives her head a dispirited shake.</p>

<p>“It is all going and coming in this world,” says she.
“To-day here, to-morrow there: ’tis like breathing on a
mirror.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” cries the young fellow, “that is a melancholy
simile. Life is something more than a breath.
I would be content to know nothing but its sorrows,
rather than think it the hollow illusion people call it.
Oh, Dolly, you must cheer up and help to give me heart.
I want all the courage I can get. After this voyage we
needn’t be separated any more. Remember, next year
I shall be skipper, and then I can take you to sea with
me.”</p>

<p>“If next year had only come!” the poor little girl
sobs, and lets her face fall upon her husband’s hand.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” the old lady chides, gently, “’tis thy
business to help and support thy husband, Dolly. Will
tears help him? Resolution is softened by them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
made weak and womanish. Your mother before you,
my child, knew what it was to part from your father.
He once went to Spain, and for many months we knew
not whether he was living or dead. You were a little
child then. What came to her, came to me, and must
come to you as it comes to all women who will needs
transplant their own hearts into men’s. Know this,
Dolly, that no love is purely sweet that has not known
trials and afflictions.”</p>

<p>“Hear that, my little one,” says the young husband,
stooping his head until his lips touch his wife’s ears.
“Let us seek a blessing in our grief, and we shall find
one. It teaches me to know my love for you&mdash;our love
for each other. Is not such knowledge blessed?”</p>

<p>“See here, Dolly,” continued the grandmother, battling
with the tears provoked by the influx of hurrying
memories which followed her reference to her own child,
Dolly’s mother. “When John is gone, we will put up
a calendar against the wall in your bedroom; and every
night, after we have worshipped God, we will prick off
a day, and you shall see how quickly the calendar grows
small under our hands. I am seventy years old, and it
was but the other day that I was dancing your mother
in my arms, and I was a young woman, and your grandfather
a hearty man, with brown hair under his wig, and
bright big eyes like yours. Why, that was fifty years
ago, and it seems but yesterday! Many’s the bitter
tear I have shed, and the grief I have borne; but the
times <i>I</i> mourn cannot come back to me, they are gone
for ever&mdash;my life is but an empty chamber now; there
is no fire in the grate, and the chairs are vacant, and I
feel so lonely that I sometimes wish I was dead. But
what is your grief? It is but a few months’ separation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and every day that dies will give you happiness. It is
not so with others, nor with me&mdash;no! no!”</p>

<p>As the old grandmother spoke, with some perception,
perhaps, of that rather discreditable characteristic of
human nature which finds the best solace for its own
trouble in the consolation that is wrought out of the
griefs of others, the girl gradually raised her head and
fixed her eyes wistfully on her husband’s, then laid her
cheek against his shoulder, as a child would whom its
tears have worn out.</p>

<p>“Grandmother,” said the young man, “I leave my
Dolly to your care, and I know you will love and cherish
her as though you were sure that any ill that came to
her would break my heart.”</p>

<p>“She cannot be dearer to me than she always was,”
answered the old lady, solemnly; “but be sure, John,
that I’ll take extra care of her, since her preciousness
is doubled by being dear to you and having your life
bound up in hers.”</p>

<p>“And you will keep her heart up with happy thoughts
of me, grandmother,” continued the young fellow, his dark
eyes made infinitely tender by the shadow of tears, “and
bid her remember that when the wind blows here it may
be a summer calm where I am, and blue sky when there
are thunderstorms here. You’ll remember this, Dolly?”</p>

<p>“Yes, John.”</p>

<p>“The calendar is a good thought of grandmother’s.
Or you may watch the flowers, Dolly; you’ll see them
fade away and leave the ground bare. By-and-by they’ll
spring up again, and they will be a promise that I am
coming back to you&mdash;coming quickly&mdash;quick as the
wind will blow me&mdash;back to my little wife, to my sweet
wife, Dolly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>She sobbed quickly with renewed passion, and clasped
his hand.</p>

<p>There was a childlike beauty in her face that made
her sorrow infinitely touching for him, who loved her
with all the strength of his great heart, to behold. He
looked wistfully at the old grandmother; but she, more
powerless than he, was brooding over the to-morrows
which were to come when he should have gone away
and left her alone with Dolly’s grief.</p>

<p>“I have a mind,” she said at last, “to send for Mr.
Newcome, the rector. He should be able to point out
to Dolly better than either of us can, that there is something
unrighteous in suffering our hearts to be overcome
by any dispensations God in His wise providence may
choose to ordain.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want Mr. Newcome,” sobbed Dolly.
“I must cry, granny. When John is gone, I’ll dry my
eyes, and think of nothing but the time when he is to
come back to me. But whilst I see him, and know that
this time to-morrow he will be gone, I can’t help crying,
indeed I can’t, granny.”</p>

<p>“Ay, my dear, but if your tears could bind him to
you, and take the place of his duties which summon
him away, they would be very well. But it is your
place to help him in his troubles, as it is his to help
you in yours; and see what a lonesome air his face has
as he watches you, because he feels himself away from
you by your refusing to listen to the words he tries to
comfort you with.”</p>

<p>“I would give my right hand to save Dolly from
these tears, grandmother,” said John, “but it is her love
that frets. By-and-by her eyes will grow bright, for she
will know that every hour which passes after I have left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
her is bringing us nearer to next summer, when we shall
be together again.”</p>

<p>“But a year is such a long time,” wailed Dolly. “It
is four times over again the months we have been together,
and it seems ages ago since you came home, John.
And granny doesn’t know the dangers of the sea. You
have never talked to her as you have to me. Haven’t
you told me of shipwrecks, and how men fall overboard,
and how some ships catch fire and not a creature saved
of all a great ship’s crew?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dolly,” he answered, smoothing her bright
hair; “but I have always said that the sea isn’t
more dangerous than the land. There’s danger everywhere
for the matter of that, isn’t there, grandmother?”</p>

<p>“Oh dear yes,” groaned the old lady; “there are
deaths going on all about us, on the dry land, quick as
our pulses beat.”</p>

<p>“Ay, true enough, grandmother,” rejoined John;
“more deaths are going on ashore than are going on at
sea. But why do we talk of death? People part and
meet again&mdash;why shouldn’t we? There is no end to
trouble if once we begin to think of what <i>may</i> happen.
A man should put his trust in <span class="lock">God”&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Yes, that first, that chiefly,” interrupted the grandmother.</p>

<p>“And fight his way onward with as much courage
and hope and resolution to win as though there were no
such thing as death in the world at all. When I bid
you good-bye, Dolly, I shan’t say good-bye, <i>perhaps for
ever</i>; no! no! I will say good-bye till next summer.
Summer is sure to come, and why shouldn’t it bring me
back?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“We will pray God that it will,” exclaimed the
grandmother.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus these honest hearts talked and hoped; but, in
truth, the parting was more bitter than Dolly could
bear.</p>

<p>On this, the eve of her husband’s leaving her, she
could see no promise in time, no sunshine in the long
and dismal blank that stretched before her. She was
quite a young bride, had been married only three
months; but his presence had already become a habit
to her, a portion of her life, a condition of her happiness.</p>

<p>She had engaged herself to him eighteen months
since, not many weeks before he sailed on his last
voyage; but though she had learnt to love him tenderly
as her sweetheart, his going did not then afflict her as
it now did. He was only her lover then, but now he
was her husband. She was ardent when she became
his wife, flushed with the sweet and gracious emotions
of her new state, and because the thought of the
approaching time threw a shadow upon her happiness,
she drove it deep down in her heart, out of sight almost,
and so unfitted herself for bravely encountering the certain
trouble that was to come.</p>

<p>It had come now; its full weight was upon her; she
thought it must break her heart.</p>

<p>When we found them, they had not long returned
from the last walk they were to take together for many
a weary month; and it was so bitterly sad to them
both, that no words can express its pathos. They were
surrounded by familiar and beloved objects; and every
detail that had heretofore made up the colour and life
of their married love now came, each with its special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
pang of sorrow, to tell them that their dream was dissolved,
and that their embraces, their whispers&mdash;indeed
their very hopes&mdash;must be postponed until a period so
far off, that it seemed as if no time would ever bring it
to them. The poor fellow did his utmost to inspirit
her; all the unsubstantial comfort he strove to lay to his
own heart he gave to her; but his broken voice made
his cheery assurances more sad even than her tears; and
down by the little river, when the evening had gathered,
and the soft stars were looking upon them, he had given
way to his grief, and wept over her as if the form he
pressed to him were lifeless.</p>

<p>The story of his courtship and marriage was as
simple as the pastoral life of the village in which it
occurred.</p>

<p>He had been called to Southbourne by his aunt, who
lived there, and who felt herself dying. He had then
just returned from a ten months’ voyage. He was fond
of his aunt, as the only living relative he had, and came
to her at once. At her house&mdash;indeed, by her bedside&mdash;he
met Mrs. Flemming, Dolly’s grandmother. Mrs.
Flemming took a fancy to him, admired his handsome
face, his honest character, the cordial tenderness of his
nature, which he illustrated by his devotion to his sick
aunt, and asked him to her house, where he met Dolly.</p>

<p>He fell in love with her; and then, but not till then,
he found that Southbourne was an infinitely better place
to live in than the neighbourhood of the West India
Docks.</p>

<p>Dolly was an innocent little creature, and hardly
knew at first what to make of the love she had inspired
in her grandmother’s young friend; but by degrees the
old story was read through between them, and the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
chapter found them betrothed with Mrs. Flemming’s
full consent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the aunt had died and left her little
savings to her nephew, who gave the money to Mrs.
Flemming to take care of for him until he came home.
He was then chief mate, aged twenty-eight. When thirty
he was to command a ship, his employers promised. So
when he returned, twenty-nine years old, with only
another year before him to serve out as a subordinate,
he claimed Mrs. Flemming’s leave to marry Dolly; and
within three weeks from the time of his arrival they
were man and wife.</p>

<p>There could be no hitch: there was nobody’s leave
but Mrs. Flemming’s to get. He and Dolly were both
of them orphans. Her parents had died when she was
a little girl; his, some years before this story begins.
His father had been skipper in the service John belonged
to, and the shipowners’ favourite captain. Indeed,
Captain Holdsworth had served his employers well, and
as a token of their gratitude, they kept their eyes on his
son; which meant that he was appointed the moment
he had passed his examination as first mate, and was to
be skipper at an age when a good many in the service
were just entering upon their duties as second in command.
But this only really argued that the owners
knew a smart seaman when they saw him. Young
Holdsworth was that; and critical as was the jealousy
his quick promotion excited, there was not a man who
could be got to say that Jack Holdsworth wasn’t as
good a sailor as ever trod upon shipboard.</p>

<p>The first thing he did, when he had the banns put
up at St. George’s, was to rent the little house that
turned its shoulder upon the Southbourne main road,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and furnish it with the money his aunt had left him.
That was to be Dolly’s and grandmother’s home. Old
Mrs. Flemming had some furniture of her own and an
annuity; this last she was to club with John’s pay,
which Dolly was to draw every month, and so they
would have money enough to keep them as ladies. But
the old grandmother’s furniture was very crazy: she of
course thought it beautiful and elegant; but this did
not prevent the chairs from breaking when John sat on
them, nor the legs of the tables from coming off when
they were handed through the doors. Such of these
relics as did not go to pieces were put into her bedroom,
at her particular request, because they enabled her to
realise old times; the rest vanished in a cloud of dust
into a distant auction-room, and were never heard of
more.</p>

<p>The young people’s life was an idyl until the time
approached for Holdsworth to sail. They went away
for a week after they were married, and Dolly saw life:
that is, she saw London, which frightened her, and she
was very glad to get home. They had pretty nearly
three months before them, and that seemed to give
them plenty of time to enjoy themselves in. To be
sure, the little cloud upon the horizon grew bigger
and bigger every day, and Dolly saw it, and knew
that in three months’ time it would have overspread the
heavens, and filled the earth with its leaden shadow;
but she shrank from looking in that direction, and
fixed her eyes on the blue sky overhead, and was as
gay under its brightness as if it were never to know an
eclipse.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flemming and Dolly had several friends in
Southbourne, and during these months tea-parties were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
pretty frequent. Even the rector asked them to tea,
and went to drink tea at their house; and this occasion
was a celebrated one, for the rector was a kind, whimsical
old gentleman, and insisted on a game of forfeits
being played. There were three girls besides Dolly
present, so kissing was practicable; and loud was the
laughter when it fell to the rector’s lot to kiss Mrs.
Flemming, which he did with such a courtier-like air,
that, under its influence, the grandmother’s memory
unfolded itself; and she instructed the company, in a
tremulous voice, and with a lean, underscoring forefinger,
in the behaviour of the men of <i>her</i> day, when
men <i>were</i> men, etc. etc. Hunt the slipper followed
the forfeits, and the evening was closed with port-negus,
October ale, and dishes of fruit, sandwiches, and
sweetmeats.</p>

<p>Hours so spent would make just such a memory as
would keep a man’s heart warm in his bosom under any
skies, in any climes, in calm or in storm. Years after
the very inscriptions on the tombs of the rector and
Mrs. Flemming were scarcely to be read amid the
encrusting moss and the toothmarks of time, John
Holdsworth remembered that evening: how, flushed as
the two Miss Lavernes were into positive prettiness by
laughter and Mr. Jackson the curate’s discreet kisses,
Dolly looked a queen to them; how her sweet eyes had
peeped at him over the rector’s shoulder, as the worthy
clergyman claimed his forfeit; how she hung about him
and sported, as any infant might, at his side, with her
laughter never so ringing and melodious as when her
hand was in his. How the kindly grandmother had
hobbled about the room, with rusty squeaks of laughter
in her mouth, to elude the rector’s reluctant pursuit;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
how Miss Nelly Laverne blushed, and giggled, and
tossed her head about when Mr. Jackson kissed her....</p>

<p>The curtain was falling, the lights were dimming,
and now tears and sighs and heartrending yearnings
were making a cruel ending of the pleasant summer
holiday.</p>

<span class="smaller">TO THE DOWNS.</span></h2></div>


<p>The “Meteor” was a full-rigged ship of eleven hundred
tons, with painted ports and a somewhat low freeboard,
which gave her a rakish look. Her figure-head represented
a woman, naked to the waist, emerging from a
cloud, and was really a sweet piece of carving. She
was a ship of the old school, with big stern windows,
and a quaint cuddy front and heavy spars. Yet, built
after the old-fashioned model, her lines were as clean as
those of an Aberdeen clipper.</p>

<p>She made a glorious picture, as she lay off Gravesend,
the clear summer sky tinting the water of the river a
pale blue, and converting it into a mirror for an ideal
representation of the graceful vessel. Many boats were
clustered about her side, and up and down her canvased
gangway went hurrying figures. The ensign was at the
peak, and at the fore floated the blue-peter, signal to
those who took concern in her that she would be soon
under weigh.</p>

<p>She was bound to New York, whence she was to
carry another cargo south, ultimately touching at Callao
before she spread her wings for the old country.</p>

<p>There were a few first-class passengers on board, and
some of them stood near the gangway in low and earnest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
talk with friends, while others were on the poop, gazing
at the shore with wistful eyes. One of these was a
widow, whose husband had been buried a few weeks
before in the churchyard of a little Kentish town. She
was taking her boy back with her to New York, where
her friends were; and there they stood, hand in hand,
the child with wondering eyes everywhere, the mother
with a fixed gaze upon the land which was consecrated
for ever to her heart by the beloved form it held.</p>

<p>The river was brilliant and busy with vessels at
anchor or passing to and fro, with boats pulling from
shore to shore, with the gay sunshine deepening and
brightening the colours of flags, or flashing white upon
the outstretched canvas, and trembling in silver flakes
upon the water. Sailors hung over the forecastle of the
“Meteor,” bandying jokes full of pathos, or exchanging
farewells with wives and sweethearts, or male friends
in boats grouped, with outstretched oars, around the
bows of the ship. Some of the hands were aloft casting
off the yard-arm gaskets, ready to sheet home when the
boatswain’s pipe should sound. The wind&mdash;a light
breeze&mdash;was north, a soldier’s wind that would take
them clear of the river, and make a fair passage for them
down Channel; and now they were only waiting for the
captain to come on board with the pilot to start.</p>

<p>By eleven o’clock the ship was to be under weigh;
and even as the clear chimes of the clock striking the
hour floated across the river from the land, a boat pulled
by three men swept alongside, and the captain, followed
by the pilot, sprang up the ladder.</p>

<p>A tall, broad-shouldered young man stood at the
gangway to receive them, and touched his cap as the
captain came on board.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“All ready, Mr. Holdsworth?”</p>

<p>“All ready, sir.”</p>

<p>“Man the windlass then.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir.”</p>

<p>He was on the forecastle in a jiffy, and the thunder
of his voice went along the deck and brought all hands
to the windlass as if a line had pulled each man to his
place. The boatswain’s pipe shrilled, the pilot’s face,
coloured like mahogany, took an anxious expression;
and then clank! clank! clank! went the windlass, followed
in a moment by a hoarse song, which at regular
intervals burst into a <span class="lock">chorus:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“And when you come to the dockyard gates,</div>
      <div class="verse indent8">Yo, boys, yo!</div>
      <div class="verse">You’ll find that Sal for her true love waits,</div>
      <div class="verse indent8">Heave, my bully-boys, heave!</div>
      <div class="verse">Then, heave my boys, oh, heave together!</div>
      <div class="verse indent8">Yo, boys, yo!</div>
      <div class="verse">And get her out o’ the stormy weather!</div>
      <div class="verse indent8">Heave, my bully-boys, heave!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then came such cries as <span class="lock">these:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Sheer off you boats there!”</p>

<p>“Get the gangway ladder in-board.”</p>

<p>“Loose the inner jib, one of you!”</p>

<p>“A hand aft to the wheel!”</p>

<p>To see young Holdsworth now was to see a sailor,
with a voice like a gale of wind, the whole great ship
and her thousand complications of spars, ropes, sails,
packed, so to speak, like a toy in the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>The skipper was below; the pilot was lord and
master now, and Holdsworth watched his face for orders.</p>

<p>Soon the cable was up and down, the anchor lifted,
and some hands left the windlass to make sail. The
tide had got the ship, and she was floating almost imper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>ceptibly
past a large American vessel that had brought-up
the evening before. A few boats followed; some
turned and made for Gravesend, the inmates standing
up and waving their hats and handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>By this time the anchor was catted, and all hands
quitted the forecastle to make sail. Then you might hear
cries of “Sheet home!” from the air; down fell great
spaces of canvas like avalanches of snow; chains rattled
through blocks; fore and aft songs and choruses were
raised and continued until silenced by the order “Belay!”
The yards rose slowly up the polished masts and stretched
the canvas tight as drum-skins. The men on board the
Yankee crowded her forecastle and gave the Britisher a
cheer as she passed. Amid the songs of the men, the
piping of the boatswain and his mates, and the noisy
commands of the pilot, the “Meteor” burst into a cloud
of canvas, chipped a white wave out of the blue river,
and went ahead like a yacht in a racing match.</p>

<p>The breeze freshened as the river widened. The
decks were quiet now, the ropes coiled down clear for
running, and everything hauled taut and snug. At
two o’clock she was foaming along under royals and
flying-jib, whisking past colliers dragging their main
channels through the water as if they were drowning
flies struggling for the land; overhauling smart
schooners and ships as big as herself, and making the
land on either side of her dwindle down and down into
flat marshy country.</p>

<p>The pilot, pompous to the last extremity, with bow
legs and moist eyes, strutted fore and aft the poop, sometimes
calling an order to the man at the wheel, and
constantly looking aloft, ahead, and around him. The
passengers lounged about the deck or hung over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
side, watching the foaming water rush past them, and
almost losing&mdash;those of them, at least, who were leaving
their homes&mdash;their sadness in the sense of exhilaration
begotten by the swift speeding of the vessel
through the glory and freshness of the summer afternoon.</p>

<p>Forward, the men were industrious in the forecastle,
rigging up their hammocks, or preparing their bunks
for the night, or overhauling their sea-chests, or the
canvas bags which, among seamen, often answer the
purpose of sea-chests. It was a queer sight to see their
busy figures in the twilight of the forecastle&mdash;here the
black face of a negro; there the broad features of a
Dutchman; here a mulatto; there a lantern-jawed
Yankee, peak-bearded and narrow-hipped&mdash;a world in
miniature, something after the nature of a menagerie,
all talking in English, with accents which made the
effect indescribable gibberish to the unaccustomed ear.
They were most of them friends already; some had
sailed in company before; and now they would suspend
their work to offer one another a chew of tobacco, to
beg the loan of a “draw,” meaning a pipe; while the
air grew insufferable to all but a seaman’s digestion,
with the smell of black cavendish and the inexpressible
odour of bilge-water, tar, hemp, and the ship’s cargo
generally, which rose, directly through the fore-hatch,
and was blown into the forecastle by the draught under
the foresail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At eight o’clock the “Meteor” was off Margate, all
sails but royals set; one of the noblest spectacles of
beauty, grace, and majesty the world has to offer&mdash;a
full-rigged ship&mdash;a leaning mountain of canvas rushing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
under the sky, with a whirl of foam bursting like two
gigantic white arms from her sides.</p>

<p>But the North Foreland brings you to a sharp turn,
and the wind had drawn three or four points to the
west, and was blowing fresh in Mid Channel as the
pilot saw by the distant Goodwin Sands on the port
bow, which lay, upon the horizon in a long streak of
foam, like the Milky-way in the sky.</p>

<p>This was a pity, because, unless they were disposed
to stand for the French shore, and so make Folkestone
by a long board, they would have to bring-up in the
Downs.</p>

<p>However, there was no help for it; for, though the
vessel’s yards were braced hard up against the lee rigging,
she continued to fall off half a point by half a
point, and, by the time she was off Ramsgate, her head
was south. But the “Meteor” could sail to windward
like a yacht. They furled the mainsail, took a single
reef in the topsails, and then all hands stood by to put
the ship about. Standing-by is sailors’ English for
being ready. The men went forward, and the ship,
with two hands at the wheel, made straight for the
South Sand Head&mdash;the southernmost portion of the formidable
Goodwin Sands.</p>

<p>The Channel was a glorious scene. The sun had
sunk behind the land, bequeathing a broad red glare to
the heavens, over which some great clouds were unfurling
themselves&mdash;livid promontories with flaring crimson
headlands. Astern rose the solid white cliffs, looking
phantasmal upon the dark-coloured water. On the right
the land swept into a bay, hugging the water flatly as
far as Deal, then rising into a great front of frowning
cliffs, which stood black against the background of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
red sky. The gloom of the gathering evening had
paled the outlines of the houses into the shadowy land;
but here and there you could see small vessels riding
close in shore, or smacks with red sails creeping round
the various points, whilst all between was the quick-running
sea, coloured by the different depths of sand
into an aspect of wild and multiform beauty. Away on
the left the water, quivering with hurrying waves polished
like oil, stretched to a dim and desolate horizon. Here
and there a brig, or a barque, ploughed laboriously for
the Downs, shipping seas like columns of snow and
lurching like a drunkard that must presently fall. The
“Meteor” overtook and passed many of these vessels as
if they were buoys, sometimes running so close alongside
as to take the wind out of their sails and set them
upright on an even keel. It was strange to look down
upon their decks, lying close to the water, and see the
steersmen gazing upwards, the masters walking to and
fro and not deigning to notice anything but their own
ships, a head or two peering over the bulwarks; to hear
the groaning and grunting of the timbers, the yelling of
the wind in the masts; and then, in a moment, to see
them pitching and tumbling astern, dwindling into toys
and scarcely perceptible among the lead-coloured waves.</p>

<p>But now the crimson had faded out from over the
land, and where it had vanished burned a strong and
steady light, topping the summit of the highest and
outermost cliff. The night fell, and all about the expanse
of water innumerable lights started into life:
lanterns of vessels in the Downs, of passing ships, of
the Goodwin beacons. The clouds which had looked
slate-coloured against the sunset were now white, and
rolled like great volumes of steam across the stars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Then right ahead of the ship rose a pale white line&mdash;a
quick, spectral play of froth, and a great, red star
shining like an arrested meteor, and which a few minutes
before seemed to be many miles distant, grew big and
lurid and dangerous.</p>

<p>A deep voice sounded along the “Meteor”&mdash;“All
hands about ship!”</p>

<p>A rush of feet and then a silence; round flew the
wheel like a firework; the red light ahead swept away
giddily to the left.</p>

<p>“Helm’s alee!”</p>

<p>The canvas shook like thunder, and the passengers
crowded aft, wondering to find the ship upright.</p>

<p>“Mainsail haul!”</p>

<p>And at this signal forth burst a loud chorus; the
released braces allowed the yards to fly round, the decks
echoed to the tramping of feet and to the cries of men;
the vessel lay over as though she must capsize; there
was a rush of inexperienced passengers to windward;
another hoarse command; round flew the foreyards, and
in a few minutes the “Meteor” was darting through the
water with her head for Deal, and the pale phosphorescent
gleam of the Goodwin Sands dying out upon the
sea on her weather quarter.</p>

<p>The ship tacked three times during the next hour;
and at half-past nine the wind lulled, and the moon
came out of the sea, a broad, yellow shield. There was
something indescribably solemn in the rising of this orb
as she climbed in a haze over the edge of the horizon,
and flashed a wedge of quivering light into the tumbling
waters. The sails of the “Meteor” caught the radiance
presently, and her long wake glittered in the light like
a trail of silver spangles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>She was in the Downs now, and in a dead calm, and
within half-an-hour she was riding at anchor, everything
furled aloft, and taut and snug as a man-of-war, with
many ships about her, resting like phantom vessels on
the surface of the water.</p>

<p>An anchor-watch was set, and the crew after smoking,
and yarning and lounging about the forecastle,
went below, and a deep repose fell upon the erewhile
busy labouring ship. The silence was unbroken, save
by the murmur of some of the passengers talking in a
group around the cuddy skylight, or by the sound of a
fiddle played in some one of the nearer-lying vessels, or
by the faint, melodious murmur of the breakers boiling
upon the pebbly strand of Deal.</p>

<p>A breathless summer night! with big shooting-stars
chasing the heavens, and a moon growing smaller and
brighter each moment, and the dim tracery of the tapering
masts and rigging of the “Meteor” pointing from
the deep and vanishing in the gloom. Away on the
left, for the tide had swung the ship round and pointed
her bowsprit up Channel, glittered the lights of Deal,
suggestions of home life which riveted many eyes and
made many hearts thoughtful and sad&mdash;none more so
than Holdsworth’s, whose watch it was, and who, now
that his active duties were over, could surrender himself
to the bitter luxury of thought.</p>

<p>He paced to and fro athwart the poop, his heart far
away in the little village he had quitted. The face of
his child-wife rose before him, and he lived again in the
hard parting that had wrenched his heart and sent him
sobbing from his home. He felt her clinging arms
about his neck; he looked down into her swollen eyes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
he repeated again and again, in broken tones, his fond
and last entreaty that she would keep her heart up,
pray for him, and think only of the joyous summer that
would come to bless and bring them together once
more.</p>

<p>The music ceased in the distance; the tinkling of
bells, announcing the half-hour past ten, came stealing
across the water, and was echoed by five ringing strokes
upon the bell on the “Meteor’s” quarter-deck.</p>

<p>Half-past ten! Was Dolly sleeping now? Had her
grief and her tears wearied her into repose? How long,
how very long, it seemed since he saw her last! The
time was to be counted in hours, but it appeared days
and weeks to him.</p>

<p>He leaned with his arms upon the poop rails, and
stood lost in thought. A question asked in a soft voice
made him turn.</p>

<p>“Do all those lights there belong to ships?”</p>

<p>The speaker was the widow to whom Holdsworth’s
attention had been several times attracted during the
day by the air of sadness her face wore, and her devotion
to her bright-haired little boy, whose sweet wondering
eyes, as he cast them round, had reminded him of
Dolly’s, and drawn his heart to him.</p>

<p>“Yes, they belong to ships at anchor like ours.”</p>

<p>“How beautiful is this night! I have left my boy
asleep and stolen from the cabin to breathe the fresh
air.”</p>

<p>“I daresay the dear little fellow sleeps well after the
excitement he has gone through. I noticed that his
wondering eyes were very busy when we were in the
river.”</p>

<p>Hearing this, she grew frank and cordial at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Her woman’s heart was as sure of him as if she had
known him all his life.</p>

<p>“Did you notice my child? I should have thought
you were too much occupied. He was tired out, God
bless him! when I put him to bed; too tired even to
say his prayers. He has no father now to love him, so
I must give him a double share of my love.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you will not find that hard. He is a manly
little fellow, and he and I will become great friends, I
hope.”</p>

<p>“I trust you will.... You are Mr. Holdsworth?
I heard the captain call you by that name. And you
are the chief mate?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam.”</p>

<p>“I admire your profession, Mr. Holdsworth, and have
a good excuse for doing so, for both my father and
brother were sailors. But I don’t think I could ever
let my boy go to sea; I could never bear to part with
him. And I sometimes wonder how the wives of sailors
can endure to be separated from their husbands.”</p>

<p>“That is the hardest part of our profession,” answered
Holdsworth quickly. “I never understood it before
this voyage. I have had to leave my young wife; may
God protect her until I come back.”</p>

<p>“Is she very young?”</p>

<p>“Nineteen.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl!” exclaimed the widow, with deep sympathy
in her voice. She added, cheerfully, “But this
separation will only make you dearer to each other.
You are sure to meet again. Time flies quickly, and all
these weary days will seem no more than a dream to
you when you are together.”</p>

<p>She sighed and glanced down at the deep crape on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
her dress. The moonlight enabled Holdsworth to notice
the glance, and the pathos of it silenced him. In the
presence of such an experience as <i>her</i> parting was&mdash;he
knew whom she had lost by her reference to her fatherless
boy&mdash;his own sorrow appeared light.</p>

<p>“There is always hope, there is always the promise
of happiness in store while there is life,” she continued
gently. “Do not be down-hearted, Mr. Holdsworth.
This parting is but a temporary interruption of your
happiness. Be sure that God will protect your young
wife while you are away, and do not doubt that He will
lead you back to her.” She smiled softly at him, and
adding, “I must go to my little one now,” bowed cordially
and went away.</p>

<p>He could have blessed her for an assurance which,
having no better foundation than a woman’s sympathy,
cheered him as no thoughts of his own could have done.
“That is a true heart,” he said to himself, and resumed
his walk, repeating her words over and over again, and
drawing a comfort from them that made his step elastic
and his eyes bright.</p>

</div>


<p>At six o’clock next morning the sleeping passengers
were awakened by cries and trampings which, to some
of them at least, were novel disturbers of their slumbers.
They might have told the reason of all this noise without
going on deck; for those who slept in cots found the
deck making an angle with their beds, and the lee port-holes
veiled with rushing green water, and all the
movables crowded together at any distance from where
they had been deposited the night before. And hoarse
cries sounded, and the flanking of massive chains, and
the strange groaning a ship makes when she heels over
to a weight of canvas.</p>

<p>Yes! the “Meteor” was under weigh, with a spanking
breeze on the starboard quarter, which she would
haul round abeam&mdash;her best point of sailing&mdash;when she
had cleared the South Foreland. If this breeze held,
the pilot said, he would be out of the ship and toasting
her in rum and water at Plymouth before the sun went
down next day.</p>

<p>Some of the passengers came on deck when the ship
was off Folkestone, and then they saw as fair a sight as
the world has to offer&mdash;the great white English cliffs
topped with swelling tracts of green, with here and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
small bays with spaces of yellow sand between; houses
thickly grouped&mdash;so it seemed in beholding them from
the sea&mdash;upon the very margin of the cliff; slate-coloured
hills paling far, far away with visionary clouds upon
them; and between the ship and the shore many
pleasure-boats and other craft, with white or ochre-coloured
sails and bright flags, lending spots of red and
blue to the perspective of the chalky cliff.</p>

<p>The pilot hugged the wind, rightly apprehensive that
it might draw ahead and cripple him for sea room;
and the “Meteor” hereabouts was so close to the land
that those on board her could see the people walking
on shore&mdash;man’s majesty illustrated by dots of black
upon the beach or the heights. Overhead was a brilliantly
blue sky, with small wool-white clouds driving
over it; the sea laughed in dimples and shivered the
white sunlight far and wide, so that every crest gleamed
with a diamond spark of its own; and away on the left,
a pale faint cloud floating upon the horizon, was the
French coast.</p>

<p>The gay panorama swept by and new scenes opened&mdash;stretches
of barren coast with ungainly Coastguards’
huts for their sole decoration; spaces of vivid green
ruled off with lines of soft brown sand, and low black
rocks mirrored in the lake-like surface of the water
under the lee; whitewashed villages with wreaths of
blue smoke curling from their midst, and broad expanses
of trees darkening the lightlier-coloured landscape with
delicate shadows. Sturdy vessels, the dray-horses of
the Channel, slow, deep laden, and wafting, many of
them, the scent of pine and other woods across the water,
were overtaken and passed, often amid the laughter
of the crew on the “Meteor’s” forecastle, and “chaff,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
which even the grave Captain Steel, the “Meteor’s”
skipper, condescended to smile at. How picturesque
these vessels! Here a Dutch barque painted white,
with square-faced men staring over the bulwarks; a red-capped
commander in sea boots and vast inexpressibles,
and a steersman who sometimes looked at the “Meteor”
and sometimes at the sails of his own ship, mixing duty
and curiosity in a manner delightful to behold; there a
North-country brig with dirty patched sails and black
rigging, and a crew with smoked faces and a grinning
head at the galley door; sometimes a French smack
with as many hands on board as would man a Black
Ball Liner, women among them in red petticoats and
handkerchiefs around their faces, some gutting fish, some
mending nets, some peeling potatoes, and all talking and
gesticulating at once, but suspending both their work and
their talk to crowd to the smack’s side and stare at the
noble English vessel; and sometimes a little open boat
at anchor, with a man in her fishing with deep gravity,
and paying no more heed to the ship in whose wake his
cockle-shell would bob like a cork float, than were he
the only tenant of the great glittering surface of water.</p>

<p>But soon the coast sank low in the horizon. The
“Meteor” was standing for the deeper water of the
Middle Channel, and close hauled, but with all sails set,
she had paled old England into a thin blue cloud, and
was heading straight for the great Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>The night passed; the morning broke; but the
“Meteor” was not out of the Channel yet. The pilot
grumbled as he cast his groggy eyes aloft and saw the
weather-leaches lifting. He would have to go about to
fetch Plymouth, unless he had a mind to cross the
Atlantic, and this was certainly not his intention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>All the passengers came on deck after breakfast; the
ladies brought out their work, the gentlemen lighted
cigars, and those who had made a voyage before looked
knowing as they cast their eyes about and asked nautical
questions of the captain.</p>

<p>As to the pilot, he was ungetatable. Moreover, his
language was so clouded with marine expletives that his
lightest answer was generally a shock to the sensibilities.</p>

<p>Every boatman from Margate to Penzance calls himself
a pilot nowadays; but the genuine pilot&mdash;such a
man as this who was taking the “Meteor” down Channel&mdash;stands
out upon the marine canvas with an individuality
that makes him unique among seafaring
human kind. Figure a square, bow-legged man, in a
suit of heavy pilot cloth, a red shawl round his neck, a
tall hat on his head, a throat the colour of an uncooked
beefsteak, and a face of a complexion like new mahogany,
small moist rolling eyes, a voice resembling the tones of
a man with the bronchitis calling through a tin trumpet,
and an undying affection for Jamaica rum. Such was
Mr. Dumling, the “Meteor’s” pilot, a man to whom the
gaunt sea-battered posts, the tall skeleton buoys, the fat
wallowing beacons, and the endless variety of lights
ashore and at sea, from the North Foreland to the
Land’s End, were as familiar and intelligible as the
alphabet is to you; who was so profoundly acquainted
with the Channel that he boasted his power to tell you
within a quarter of a mile of where he was, by the mere
faculty of smell! A man who could look over a ship’s
side and say, “Here are four fathoms of water, and
yonder are nine,” “And where the shadow of the cloud
rests the water is twelve fathoms deep;” and so on,
every inch of the road, for miles and miles&mdash;a miracle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of memory! To appreciate the value of such a man you
should be with him in the Channel in a pitch-dark night,
blowing great guns from the north-east, with the roar
of the Goodwin on the lee bow, and a sea so heavy that
every blow the ship receives communicates the impression
that she has struck the ground, while the black air
is hoarse with the gale and fogged with stinging spray.</p>

<p>The wind is nowhere more capricious than in the
English Channel. At one o’clock the spanking breeze
swept round to the south-east; the watch went to work
at the braces; up went the foretopmast-stun’sail, and the
“Meteor” rushed ahead at twelve knots an hour.</p>

<p>“We shall be off Plymouth at eight o’clock,” says
the pilot, and went below to lunch with a serene face.</p>

<p>He was right. At eight o’clock the “Meteor” was
lying with her main yards backed, dipping her nose in
a lively sea, with a signal for a boat streaming at her
mast-head.</p>

<p>The passengers might take their last look at old
England then, whilst the glorious sunset bathed the land
in gold, and made the wooded shores beautiful with
colour and shadow. And now, dancing over the waters,
came a white sail, which dimmed slowly into an ashen
hue as the crimson in the skies faded and the waters
darkened.</p>

<p>“Any letters for shore?” says Captain Steel, moving
among the passengers, and soon his hand grows full.
Many of the men come forward and deliver missives for
the wife, for Sue, for Poll, to the skipper, who gives
them to the pilot. The boat, glistening with the sea-water
she has shipped, sweeps alongside, ducks her sail,
and is brought up by a line flung from the main chains.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, cap’n,” says the gruff pilot; “wish you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
a pleasant voyage, I’m sure, gen’l’men and ladies;”
drops into the main chains, and from the main chains
drops into the boat; the sail is hoisted, a hat waved, a
cheer given from the ship’s forecastle, and away bounds
the lugger in a cloud of spray.</p>

<p>Now bawls Captain Steel from the break of the
poop; round swing the main yards; the noble ship
heels over, trembles, and starts forward, and, with the
expiring gleam of the sunset upon her highest sails, the
“Meteor” heads for the broad Atlantic, and glides into
the gloom and space of the infinite, windy night.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN THE ATLANTIC.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There were eight passengers and twenty-seven hands,
counting captain and officers, on board the “Meteor;”
in all, thirty-five souls.</p>

<p>In these days half that number of men would be
thought ample to handle a ship of eleven hundred tons.
Taking fourteen men as a ship’s company, we find&mdash;one,
the cook, who is useless aloft; five ordinary seamen,
equal to two able-bodied men; four ill and unable
to leave their bunks; the remainder consist of the captain,
two mates, and the carpenter. So that a summons
for all hands to shorten sail, for example, brings forth
about enough men to do the work of one yard&mdash;one
yard, when there are twelve, exclusive of trysails, jibs,
stun’sails, spanker, and staysails. This modern system
of undermanning ships is an evil next in magnitude to
that of sending crazy and leaky vessels to sea; and as
many ships are lost for want of hands to work them on
occasions which demand promptitude and muscle, as are
lost by rotten planks and overcharged cargoes.</p>

<p>The passengers on board the “Meteor” consisted of
four gentlemen, two ladies, a little boy, and a female
servant. Of the gentlemen, one was a young man
named Holland, who was going to America for no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
purpose than to see Niagara; another was a merchant,
who was to represent a London house in New York.
He was accompanied by his wife and her maid. The
third was a General in the United States Army, a fine
old man with a chivalrous courtesy of manner and a
handsome honest face, who had been picking up what
professional hints he could find by a year’s sojourn in
the military depôts of Great Britain. The fourth male
passenger was an actor, magnificently named Gerald
Fitzmaurice St. Aubyn, in quest of more appreciative
audiences in the New Country than his genius had encountered
in the Old. The widow and her son completed
the list.</p>

<p>It took these good people a very short time to settle
down to their new life and adjust themselves to the
novel conditions of existence that surrounded them.
The ladies lay hidden at the first going off; and,
although Mr. St. Aubyn put in a punctual appearance
at meals and smoked a great quantity of cheroots, it
must be admitted that he was peculiarly pensive for a
comedian, whose genius, he affirmed, was chiefly at home
in genteel farce, though he had enacted tragedy with
applause.</p>

<p>The “Meteor” met with adverse winds, but brilliant
weather, during the first few days. She tacked north
and south, and crowded canvas to make headway, but,
though her speed was great through the water, her actual
progress was small.</p>

<p>“No matter,” said Captain Steel, patiently; “we
may get a gale astern of us some of these hours, and
then we’ll make up for lost time.”</p>

<p>But whilst the weather remained so beautiful, the
wind brisk and the sea smooth, the passengers could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
hardly regret the delay. It was like yacht sailing&mdash;dry
decks, steady motion, and always the pleasurable sense
of swiftness inspired by the beaded foam crisping by
and stretching like a tape astern. Now and again they
signalled a ship homeward bound or journeying south.
The widow’s little boy clapped his hands to see the
bright flags flying at the mizzen-peak, and the ladies
were lost in wonderment to think that those gay colours
were a language as intelligible to those concerned in
their interpretation as “How do you do?” and “Very
well, thank you.”</p>

<p>The “Meteor” had a snug cuddy; and a hospitable
sight was the dinner-table, with the white cloth covering
the long board, the gleaming silver and glass, the fine
claret jug (testimonial by former passengers to the captain),
the colours of wines in decanters, the grinning
negro always colliding with the steward, and the skipper’s
rubicund face, relieved by soft white hair, at the
head of the table, backed by the polished mizzen-mast.
Overhead was the skylight, through which you might
see the great sails towering to the heavens; and over
the dinner table swung a globe of gold-fish between two
baskets of ferns. There was a piano lashed abaft the
mizzen-mast; and all around the cuddy were the cabins
occupied by the passengers, the captain, the mates, with
highly-varnished doors and white panels relieved with
edgings of gold.</p>

<p>Everybody took an interest in the widow’s little boy,
both because he was a pretty child, and because it was
whispered about that he had lost his father but a few
weeks ago. He and Holdsworth became great friends,
as Holdsworth had said they would. Whenever it was
the first mate’s watch on deck, the little fellow would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
paddle away from his mother’s side and come to him,
and ask him to tell him stories, and show him the ship’s
compass, at which he was never weary of looking. Then
you might see Holdsworth on a hencoop, or the skylight,
with the child upon his knee, coining nautical fairy-yarns
of people who live under the sea, and ride in chariots
composed of coral, to which fish with scales shining like
precious stones are harnessed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the widow, whose name was Tennent,
would come on deck and find them together, when she
would sit beside them and listen with a smile to Holdsworth,
whose stories the little boy Louis would on no
account suffer his mamma to interrupt. And to repay
him for his kindness to the child, and not more for that
than because she admired his honest nature, and was
won by his gentle and tender simplicity, she would lead
him on, with a world of feminine tact, to talk of his
wife, and comfort and make him happy with her sympathy,
her interest, and her assurances.</p>

<p>She was a calm, gentle-faced woman, with a settled
sorrow in the expression of her eyes that made her look
older than she was, but her age would scarcely exceed
thirty-six. She showed little inclination to converse
with the other passengers, and would retire early at
night, and in the daytime sit in quiet places about the
deck, always with her boy beside her.</p>

<p>The merchant’s wife, on the other hand, Mrs. Ashton,
was a gay, talkative woman, a showy dresser, and fond
of a quiet boast, which her husband, a short man with
a yellow beard, took care never to contradict. Mr.
Holland began to pay her attention straightway, and
then Mr. St. Aubyn stepped in with theatrical emphasis
and smooth observations, like the speeches in comedies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Captain Steel, though very polite to this lady, inclined
to Mrs. Tennent,&mdash;his sailor’s heart appreciating her
defencelessness, and propounding all kinds of problems
how best to amuse, please, and cheer her. But though
she could not fail to like the honest skipper, she evidently
preferred Holdsworth, who would go and talk to her for
an hour at a time about Dolly, and then listen, with a
face of kindliest sympathy, to little passages out of her
own life.</p>

<p>And so a week went by, and the ship strove with
the baffling winds, which blew directly from the quarter
to which her bowsprit should have pointed, and captain
and men began to chafe, finding the job of putting the
ship about tiresome at last.</p>

<p>On the seventh day, about the hour of sunset, the
wind fell, and the surface of the sea became polished as
glass, though from the north-east there came, through
the mighty expanse of water, a long and regular swell,
which made the ship rise and fall as regularly as the
breath of a sleeper.</p>

<p>“We shall have the wind from that quarter, I think,
sir,” said Holdsworth to the skipper.</p>

<p>“Or is this an after-swell, Mr. Holdsworth?” suggested
the skipper, sending his keen gaze across the sea to
the horizon, where the sky was as blue as it was overhead.</p>

<p>There was no telling. This long and regular swell
might be the precursor of a gale, or the effects of one
that had passed. The barometer had fallen, but this
might only indicate a southerly wind, not necessarily
dirty weather. The heavens were perfectly tranquil; the
day was fading into a serene and gloriously beautiful
evening, with no hint in all its benign aspect to suggest
the need of the slightest precaution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton was at the piano, accompanying Mr. St.
Aubyn to a song, which he sang so affectedly that some
of the hands forward mimicked him, and the forecastle
seemed full of guinea-pigs.</p>

<p>Her husband popped his head over the skylight and
called to her to come and view the sunset. Up she
came, escorted by Mr. Holland and the actor, flounced
showily into a chair, and fell into a rapture.</p>

<p>“Oh, how beautiful! The sea looks like gold! doesn’t
it, Captain Steel? See how red the sails are! Ah, if
I could only paint! what fame such a picture as this
would bring me.”</p>

<p>True; but then what manner of pigments was needful
to reproduce the glory, the colour, the calm, the
infinity of that wonderful scene!</p>

<p>The sun was sinking down a cloudless horizon, and
was now a vast crimson ball, throbbing and quivering
with his lower limb upon the sea-line. There was something
overwhelming in the unspeakable majesty of his
unattended descent. As the huge crimson body appeared
to hang for some moments above the sea before
dipping, even Mrs. Ashton held her tongue, and seemed
impressed with the tremendous spectacle of loneliness
submitted by the globe of fire sinking away from the
sky with the vast solitude of the deep in the foreground.
Far into the measureless ocean he had sunk a cone of
fire, while the heights above and around him were dim
with burning haze. The sails of the “Meteor” were
yellow in the expiring light; her topmasts seemed veined
with lines of flame; and the brass-work about her decks
reflected innumerable suns, each with threads of glory
about it, that blinded the eyes to encounter.</p>

<p>But even while they gazed the sun vanished, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
darkness came with long strides across the deep, kindling
the stars and transforming the masts and yards of
the ship into phantom tracery as delicate as frostwork
to look at.</p>

<p>“Upon my word!” exclaimed Mr. Holland in a tone
of rapture, “that’s as fine a sight as I must hope to see
anywhere.”</p>

<p>“If you could introduce a scene like that, Mr. St.
Aubyn, on the stage, eh?” laughed the General.</p>

<p>“Why, as to that,” replied Mr. St. Aubyn, “let me
tell you, General, that there are some very fine scenes
to be found in the large theatres in London. In the
second act of ‘Pizarro,’ as I saw it the other night at
Drury Lane, there’s a scene representing the Temple of
the Sun; the sun is setting&mdash;and God knows how they
managed it, but the sun <i>did</i> sink, not like yonder one, but
very finely in clouds, just as ‘Ataliba’ exclaims, drawing
his sword, ‘Now, my brethren, my sons, my friends, I
know your valour. Should ill success assail us.’”...</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” interrupted Mr. Holland impatiently;
“but I always considered ‘Pizarro,’ as a play, to be full
of very poor rant. Who talks in real life like the
fellows in that piece are made to talk?”</p>

<p>“My dear sir!” exclaimed Mr. St. Aubyn with a
smile of contempt, “the stage is the arena of poetry;
we are idealists.”...</p>

<p>“Because you never mean what you say,” said Mr.
Ashton, lighting a cigar.</p>

<p>“Oh, excuse me,” rejoined Mr. St. Aubyn; “true
actors are always in earnest. Siddons was.”</p>

<p>“I once met Sarah Siddons,” said Mrs. Ashton.
“Do you remember, dear, at Lord Shortlands?” addressing
her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was only once at a theatre in my life,” observed
Captain Steel, who had been listening to the conversation
with an impressed face. “That was at Plymouth.
They gave us our money’s worth. There was plenty of
fighting and love-making, and two traitors, both of
whom died game and covered with blood. There was
a little too much gunpowder at the end; but I rather
think they raised smoke to hide the acting, which fell
off as the piece made headway. The best part of the
entertainment, to my thinking, was a fight between two
sailors in a private box. Mr. St. Aubyn, where do you
gentlemen, when you are run through the body, stow
all the blood you lose? That’s often puzzled me to
think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t let me hear,” cried Mrs. Ashton. “I hate
to be told such secrets.”</p>

<p>“Captain,” said the General, “how long is this calm
going to last?”</p>

<p>“All night, I am afraid. How’s her head?” sang
out the captain.</p>

<p>“East-south-east, sir,” responded the man at the
wheel.</p>

<p>“We’re homeward bound,” said the captain laughing;
“the old girl wants to get back again.”</p>

<p>He walked away from the group, and stood near the
wheel, gazing aloft and around. The passengers continued
talking and laughing, their voices sounding unreal
when listened to at a distance, and with the great,
desolate, silent sea breathing around. The sails flapped
lazily aloft, and the wheel-chains clanked from time to
time as the vessel rose and fell. Mrs. Tennent came
on deck, the captain joined her, and they walked up
and down. On the other side of the deck paced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
second mate. Forward were the dark shadows of some
of the hands upon the forecastle, smoking pipes and
talking in low voices.</p>

<p>The night had fallen darkly; there was no moon,
but the stars were large and brilliant, and glittered in
flakes of white light in the sea. Presently a fiddle was
played in the forecastle, and a voice sang a mournful
tune that sounded weirdly in the gloom, and with a
muffled note. The air and voice were not without
sweetness, but there was the melancholy in it which
many songs popular among sailors have, and the wailing
cadence was helped out by the ghostly sails rearing
their glimmering spaces, and the subdued plash of the
water about the bows, as the ship sank into the hollows
of the swell.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tennent stopped, with the captain, at the poop-rail
to listen.</p>

<p>“What odd music!” cried Mrs. Ashton. “It sounds
as if some one were playing out in the sea there.”</p>

<p>“Let’s have the fiddler here,” said Mr. Holland. “I
like to enlarge my mind by observation, and have never
yet heard a real Jack Tar sing.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! oh yes!” exclaimed Mrs. Ashton, while
Mr. St. Aubyn called out, “I’ll go and fetch him.”</p>

<p>“Better stop where you are, sir,” said the skipper,
drily; “the forecastle’s a dangerous hold for landsmen
to put their heads into. Mr. Thompson,” he called to
the second mate, “just go and send that fiddler aft
here.”</p>

<p>Presently came the man, followed at a respectful
distance by a crowd of his mates, who drew to the capstan
on the quarterdeck, and waited for what was to
follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>The fiddler and vocalist was a stumpy seaman, with
black whiskers, a hooked nose, and keen black eyes,
dressed in loose canvas breaches, well smeared with
tar, and a canvas shirt, with a belt about his
middle, in which was a sheath-knife. He hailed
from Southampton, but had gone so many voyages
in every species of ships&mdash;Danish, French, Spanish,
American&mdash;that he might fairly claim to belong to the
whole world.</p>

<p>He scraped with his left foot, and stood bashfully
awaiting orders, his glittering eyes travelling over the
group of gentlemen and ladies.</p>

<p>“You’re wanted to sing a song, Daniels,” said Captain
Steel.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir. What might it be?”</p>

<p>“Something wild and plaintive,” suggested Mrs.
Ashton.</p>

<p>“Give us a song about a sweetheart,” said Mr.
Holland.</p>

<p>This was English to the sailor; so, after a few moments’
reflection, he screwed his fiddle into his neck,
scraped a few bars, and then sang.</p>

<p>He did his best, and murmurs from time to time
about the capstan illustrated enthusiastic appreciation
in one portion of his audience at least. Those on the
poop were more quiet, impressed by the peculiar wildness
of the song, and the rough, uncouth melody of the
tune.</p>

<p>The song was about a woman whose husband was a
sailor. The sailor went away to sea, and did not come
home, and she thought he had deserted her; so she put
on man’s clothes, shipped on board a vessel as a “hand,”
and went in search of him. One night she is on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
forecastle, on the look-out. The watch are asleep;
there’s not a breath of air:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">When, looking over the starboard side,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">She sees a face as pale</div>
      <div class="verse">As snow upon a mountain top,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Or moonlight on a sail.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The figure attached to the face rises, waist high, out of
the water, and extends his hands.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“O God!” she screams, “is this my love?</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Can this my Joey be?”</div>
      <div class="verse">And then she casts her eyes above</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">And jumps into the sea.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And sure enough the phantom <i>was</i> Joey, who had not
deserted her, as she had cruelly thought, but had been
drowned in the very spot where the vessel she was on
board of was becalmed. The song wound up with an
injunction to all wives or sweethearts of sailors never to
think that their Joes have played them false because
they do not return to their homes.</p>

<p>The passengers thanked the man for his song, and
Mrs. Ashton wanted another; but Captain Steel, holding
that enough condescension had been exhibited, bade the
singer go to the steward and get a “tot of grog.”</p>

<p>Much criticism followed; but all, with the exception
of Mr. St. Aubyn, owned themselves impressed by the
rough simplicity and tragical theme of the forecastle
ballad.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” cried the actor; “put the man on a stage
before an audience, and he’d be hissed off. It’s the
queer scratching of the catgut and the picturesque costume
of the fellow that have pleased you. His voice
isn’t good enough to get him the post of call-boy at a
theatre.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>A warm argument followed this decision, and lasted
nearly half an hour, during which the General and Mr.
Ashton left the group; then the steward’s bell rang,
and the passengers went below to their nightly potations
and to munch sweet biscuits.</p>

<span class="smaller">A GALE OF WIND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>At midnight Holdsworth came on deck to relieve the
second mate. A man out of the port watch came to
the wheel, and stood yawning, scarcely awake. The
night was dark&mdash;a hazy atmosphere through which the
stars gleamed sparely, and the sea like ebony. The
rise and fall of the ship flapped the sails against the
masts and drove eddies of air about the decks, but in
reality there was not a breath of wind.</p>

<p>There was something stupendous in the black, profound,
and breathless placidity of the night. The compass
swung round in the binnacle anywhere, but the
swell made the rudder kick heavily now and again, and
gave the wheel a twist that flung the spokes out of the
man’s hand and woke him up.</p>

<p>This prolonged inactivity was galling. One longed
to hear the rush of parting water and the singing of the
wind in the shrouds.</p>

<p>The mainsail flapped so heavily that Holdsworth
ordered it to be furled. The song of the men brought
the captain on deck. He flitted, shadow-like, about
the binnacle, sniffed at the night impatiently, and then
went to Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“The glass has fallen half an inch since eight bells,”
said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; there’ll be a change before morning.”</p>

<p>“Better stow the royals and mizzen-top gall’ns’l.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir.”</p>

<p>These, the topmost sails of the ship, were just discernible
from the deck. In a few moments their dim
outlines melted, and some dark figures went up into the
gloom and vanished.</p>

<p>The captain returned to his cabin, and Holdsworth
strolled the deck. At two bells (one o’clock) the haze
went out of the sky and the stars shone fiercely. Holdsworth,
standing on the starboard side of the poop, felt
a light air creeping about his face, and the sound of the
flapping sails ceased.</p>

<p>“How’s her head?”</p>

<p>“North-a-quarter-west, sir.”</p>

<p>He sang out an order, and a crowd of figures came
tumbling out of the forecastle and manned the port
braces. The air died away, but presently came a quick
puff which made the water bubble around the ship.</p>

<p>Holdsworth’s eyes were upon the weather-horizon.
The stars burned purely, but away upon the water-line
was a thick shadow.</p>

<p>Again the wind died out and there was a breathless
stillness, amid which you might hear a sound&mdash;vague,
murmurous, indescribable&mdash;a distant echo it might
seem of something infinitely distant.</p>

<p>“Stand by the topgallant halliards!”</p>

<p>A sense of expectation seemed to pervade the very
ship herself as she stood upright with her dim canvas
flapping in the darkness above.</p>

<p>The distant murmur grew more defined, and took
such a tone as you may hear in small sharp rain falling
at a distance upon leaves. Then, out of the murky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
horizon some clouds came rolling&mdash;long, attenuated
shadows, resembling visionary arms clutching at the
stars. The murmur approached; the clouds, swinging
along the sky, formed into compact groups. Hark to
the quick hissing of the water lashed by the wind!</p>

<p>In a moment the sails were round and hard, the
ship with her port-chains under water, and the wind
screeching fiercely over the ebony surface of the sea,
and whitening it with foam.</p>

<p>The captain was on the poop, holding on to the
main-topgallant backstay, and shrieking orders like one
possessed. It was indeed briefly a case of “Let go
everything!” Under full topsail, foresail, staysails,
and jibs, the ship was too heavily weighted for the surprising
violence of the wind, and was powerless to right
herself. But every order given was the right one.
And now you heard the deep tones of Holdsworth’s
powerful voice mingling with the agitated commands of
the skipper, while yards came rushing down upon the
caps, and sails banged and roared aloft, and men shouted
lustily about the decks, and the sea fled in cataracts of
foam under the vessel’s bows.</p>

<p>A time of deep excitement, but scarcely of suspense&mdash;there
was too much hurrying for that.</p>

<p>There would have been something incredible to an
inexperienced landsman in the sight of the dark figures
swarming up the shrouds to give battle to the wild array
of canvas which groaned and bellowed like a dozen
thunderstorms in the sky&mdash;a spectacle of human pluck
not to be realised, or in the faintest degree appreciated,
by those who have not beheld it. The night black&mdash;the
yards slanting so that the extremity of the main-yard
touched the water; the footing upon those yards a thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
line which must be felt for by the feet; the canvas,
loosened by the lowering of the yard, bellied by the
force of the wind many feet above the heads of the
reefers, and presenting to their hands a surface of iron;
and the three masts quivering under the shocks and
convulsions of the sails!</p>

<p>All hands were at work now, and there were men
enough to reef both big topsails at once, whilst others
over their heads furled the topgallant sails. Holdsworth
had been one of the first to spring up the main rigging;
he knew the value of every pair of hands in that
moment of danger; and away&mdash;active, daring, his
hands and arms like steel&mdash;he clambered for the weather-earing.
But the boatswain was before him, so he made
for the lee yard-arm.</p>

<p>Figure a smooth spar, fifty-five feet long, sloping at
a height of as many feet to the water’s surface, the said
surface not being a mill pond, but a sheet of foam;
figure a pitch dark night, a line stretched along the yard,
down which you must slide to the extremity, a sail
weighing half a dozen tons banging at your head and
your feet, and doing its utmost to throw you; then,
having reached the extremity of the yard, figure your
legs thrown across it as you might bestride a horse,
beneath you the foaming sea, almost at right angles the
inclined deck of the ship, a long stone’s throw distant&mdash;a
deep darkness everywhere, save where a wave, breaking
massively, flings out a phosphorescent light and
deepens the blackness of its own chasm&mdash;whilst the
gale yells about your ears, and blinds you with spray
that stings like hail!</p>

<p>Figure this, and you will then very faintly realise
what “taking the lee-earing” in a gale at sea means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>The cries of the men aloft, and the beating of the
canvas, sounded like an unearthly contest in mid-air;
but they ceased presently, and then the hands came
hurrying down the rigging and fell to the halliards.
Holdsworth sprang on to the poop, his cap gone, his
hair blown about his eyes, and roared out orders, while
the captain, more easy in his mind about his spars, went
aft and hung about the binnacle, watching the compass
often.</p>

<p>The ship was now under double-reefed topsails, and
reeling through the darkness almost bare of sail. The
wind was increasing in violence every five minutes, and
an ugly Atlantic sea was running right athwart the
ship’s course, hurling great waves against her starboard
beam, which ran in waterspouts of foam as high as the
main-top, and was blown in big hissing flakes through
the rigging to leeward. It was soon deemed expedient
to close-reef the topsails; but even under these mere
streaks of canvas the “Meteor” lay over to the gale
down to her water-ways, and the water bubbling in her
lee scuppers. But luckily the gale was right abeam,
and the vessel could hold her course; but her speed was
comparatively small, and she laboured heavily.</p>

<p>So passed the darkest hours of the night. At four
o’clock the gale was at its worst. They had rigged up
a hurricane-house in the mizzen rigging&mdash;a square of
tarpaulin, which the wind flattened hard against the
shrouds&mdash;and under this shelter sat Holdsworth and
the captain, scarce able to hear their own voices, pitched
in the loudest key, amid the howling of the tempest.
Once Holdsworth went below to look at the glass, and
came back saying it was steady. The skipper roared
that he never before remembered so sudden a gale, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Holdsworth owned that only once was he so caught&mdash;in
the Pacific, when they lost their fore-topmast.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be done, unless they
hove the ship to; but this was not needful. The dawn
broke at five, and the pale cheerless light illuminated a
wild and dreary scene of tumbling desolate waters
billowing in mountains to the horizon. The “Meteor,”
almost under bare poles, her yards pointed to the gale,
her ropes and lines blown in semicircles to leeward,
laboured heavily, caught now by a sea that threw her
on her beam-ends, and now swooping into a chasm
walled with boiling green water, making the gale screech
like a million steam-whistles through her rigging, as she
drove up against it, while coiling tongues of water ran
in cataracts up her glistening sides and fell in dead
weights upon her decks. The sky, from horizon to
horizon, was a dark lead colour, along which under-clouds,
in appearance resembling volumes of smoke,
were swept along, torn and rent, and discharging at
intervals quick, biting showers of rain.</p>

<p>Some of the passengers came on deck&mdash;the General,
Mr. Holland, and Mr. St. Aubyn. The General turned
about when he had advanced a few feet, and disappeared;
Mr. Holland in a very short time followed his example;
but the actor, with manifest looks of terror in his pallid
face, pushed onwards with outstretched hands for the
hurricane-house. The captain advised him to go below;
but at that moment the ship, rolling suddenly to windward,
shipped a shower of spray, which soaked the poor
actor through and through; a moment after, the vessel
heeled heavily over to leeward; away rolled the actor,
impelled both by the wind and the unerring law of
gravitation, and was flung against the lee mizzen rigging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to which he was pinned by the violence of the gale as
effectually as if he had been lashed to the shrouds.
He screamed for help, on which Holdsworth went over
to him, took him by the arm, and dragged him against
the wind to the companion-hatchway. As Mr. St.
Aubyn staggered below, clinging like a kitten to whatever
he could lay hands on, he was heard to implore
Holdsworth to tell him if there was any danger; but,
before the words were out of his mouth, Holdsworth
was clinging to the weather-rigging and calling the
captain’s attention to a brig, which had risen out of the
sea like an apparition, and was tearing before the gale
with full topsails and topgallant-sails set.</p>

<p>“A Yankee, by her build!” said the captain. “It’s
only a Yankee who would carry that sail in such a
wind.”</p>

<p>It was a sight to see her flying along, sinking her
hull sometimes out of sight, then poised on the giddy
summit of a huge wave, whose crest broke under her
bows, her copper bottom glistening like red gold against
the slate-coloured water. She passed within a quarter
of a mile of the “Meteor’s” weather-beam, and up flew
the stripes and stars and stood like a painted board at
her peak. The second mate answered the salutation by
bending on the small ensign and running it up. Any
further signalling was out of the question in that gale.
The men on board the brig could just be made out.
She was a smart vessel, black-hulled, with bows like a
knife, and skysail poles, which gave her masts an aspect
of perfect symmetry; and she was splendidly handled.
She went like a swan over the seething billows, streaming
a foaming wake, and in a very few moments was lost in
the haze and gloom of the near horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>As the morning advanced the gale decreased, but a
terrible sea was up, which made the ship labour so
furiously that to steady her in some degree they set the
trysail and foresail. There was, however, the comfort
of daylight abroad, and the men could see what they
were about. Both Holdsworth and the captain went
below to get a little sleep, and the vessel was left in
command of the second mate, a young man named
Thompson. There were two hands at the wheel, and
two on the look-out on the forecastle, glittering in oil-skins,
and ducking now and again to the seas which
swept over the ship’s bows.</p>

<p>The fore and main hatches were battened down, and
the main-deck was a foot deep in water, which washed
to and fro as the ship rolled, and which, as fast as it
ran through the scupper-holes, was replaced by fresh
and heavy inroads of the sea.</p>

<p>But all this was trifling; the vessel was snug, the
gale was moderating, and the extra sail that had been
made was driving the ship through the water in fine style.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the passengers below, having been reassured
by the captain, were making what breakfast they
could off the rolls, tea, and rashers of ham which clattered
about the table, and tumbled into their laps. The trays
swung wildly from the deck, and it demanded great
vigilance and close attention to their convulsive movements
to repossess oneself of the cup or plate one
placed upon them for safety. The negro steward
shambled round the table, halting every moment to
make a grasp at anything that came in his road, to
steady himself. Now and again you heard the smash
of crockery. Some conversation was attempted; and
the General invited Mr. Holland to go up on deck and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
witness a scene which would probably exceed in majesty
Niagara Falls; but Mr. Holland said he would wait until
the vessel was steadier. Mr. St. Aubyn had changed his
clothes and sat holding on to the table, looking the part
of fear infinitely better than he could hope to impersonate
it before the footlights. The ladies remained in their
cabins. Mrs. Ashton, overcome with sickness and the
fear of drowning, was driving her maid distracted with
orders, which it was out of the poor wretch’s power to
execute. In truth, the maid’s legs were perfectly useless
to her, which Mrs. Ashton, lying on her back, refused
to understand. Cries were repeatedly coming from the
direction of her cabin for “Harry! Harry!” which received
no attention, owing to Harry’s&mdash;in other words,
to Mr. Ashton’s&mdash;utter incapacity to move a step without
being flung upon the deck.</p>

<p>A somewhat different scene was presented by the interior
of the forecastle, where both watches were having
breakfast. Men holding tin pannikins stepped easily
round to the galley, where the cook was dispensing a
milkless, sugarless black fluid called tea, and retreated
into the twilight of the forecastle, carrying the steaming
beverage. There sat the sailors, some swinging in hammocks
with their legs dangling down, some on sea-chests,
some on canvas bags, drinking from pannikins, swallowing
lumps of biscuit hard as iron, or hacking with the
knives they wore in their belts at bits of cold pork or
beef, floating in vinegar, in tin dishes held between
their knees; some smoking, some making ready to
“turn in,” and all jabbering away as gaily as if they
were comfortably seated in a Liverpool or Poplar singing-house&mdash;the
mariner’s earthly paradise&mdash;and each with
his Sue or his Betsey at his side. Here, more than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
any other part of the ship, you felt her motion&mdash;the
mighty lifting of her bows, and the long sweeping fall
as she pitched nose under, while the heavy seas boomed
against her outside as though at any moment the timbers
must dispart and the green waves rush in.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock the gale had decreased to such a
degree that they were able to shake two reefs out of the
main top-sail and set the topgallant sail. The action of
the sea, moreover, was much less violent. The weather
had cleared, the pale blue sky could be seen shining
through the white mist that fled along it, and the sun
stood round and clean and coppery in the heavens,
throwing a dark red lustre upon the quick, passionate
play of the sea beneath.</p>

<p>Some of the passengers crawled upon deck and gazed
with wonderment around them. Certainly the panorama
was a somewhat different one from what had been unrolled
to their eyes the day before. The ship had a
fagged and jaded look with her drenched decks, her
ropes blown slack with the violence of the wind, and
the canvas made unequal to the eye by the reefs in the
topsails. It was again Holdsworth’s watch on deck.
The captain walked up and down chuckling over the
improved aspect of the weather and on the wind, which
was drawing more easterly, and therefore more favourable.</p>

<p>“You can shake out the reefs, Mr. Holdsworth.
She’ll bear it now,” he called out.</p>

<p>Out reefs it was: the ship felt the increased pressure,
and rushed forward like a liberated racehorse.</p>

<p>“This is capital!” exclaimed the old General, tottering
about with outstretched hands, ever on the alert for
a special roll. “A week of this, captain, will carry us
a good way on our road.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ay, sir, and we must make up for lost time.”</p>

<p>And then presently he gave orders to set the mainsail
and the other two topgallant sails.</p>

<p>“The glass still keeps low, sir,” said Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“But let’s take advantage of the daylight, Mr. Holdsworth.
We mustn’t lose an opportunity.”</p>

<p>The sky had now cleared, the sun shone cheerily;
the wind, having drawn aft, was now no more than
what sailors would call a main-royal breeze. The foretopmast
stun’sail was set. The passengers regained
their spirits, and though the ship still rolled pretty
freely, Mr. St. Aubyn and Mr. Holland, to show that
they were now masters of their legs, walked up and
down the deck, diversifying their conversation with
sundry stumbles, and now and then by falling against
each other. But the bright sunshine made such <i>contretemps</i>
a source of merriment. Moreover, the ladies were
on deck now, Mrs. Ashton having been pushed up the
companion-ladder by her husband, who, in his turn, had
met with great assistance behind from the kindly hands
of the negro steward, who was anxious to get them both
out of the cuddy, that he might show his teeth to the
maid-servant. Captain Steel seeing Mrs. Ashton attended
by the other gentlemen, who were industrious
in their inquiries after her nerves, gallantly gave his
arm to the widow, whilst her little boy ran to Holdsworth,
who took his hand, kissed and began to talk to
him, finding endless pleasure in looking into his eyes
and humouring the suggestions of home-life, of flowers,
of women’s love, of his own wife, which were somehow
conveyed to him by the boy’s prattle and wise child-smiles
and perfect innocence.</p>

</div>


<p>At five o’clock the wind was south-east; a fresh breeze,
with a lively sea and a cloudy sky. The wind being aft,
the ship sailed on an even keel, to the great comfort of
the passengers, who found the inclined decks intolerable.</p>

<p>From the aspect of the sea, it was evident that the
ship had got into water which had not been touched by
the gale of the morning&mdash;of such narrow proportions
sometimes are the tempests which sweep the ocean.
Away northwards, whither the clouds were rolling, there
loomed a long, low, smoke-coloured bank of cloud or fog,
so exactly resembling a coast seen from a distance that
the passengers were deceived, and some of them called
out that yonder was land!</p>

<p>“Tell us now, captain,” cried Mrs. Ashton; “it <i>is</i>
land, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Why, madam,” rejoined the captain, “for anything
I can tell, it may be Laputa.”</p>

<p>“Or Utopia,” suggested the General, “the land of
idealisms and paradisaical institutions.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton laughed, seeing the joke, but Mr. St.
Aubyn, conceiving that they were talking of real countries,
proposed that the captain should head the vessel
for the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, no! too far out of my course,” answered the
skipper, with a wise shake of the head. “It would
make a Flying Dutchman of the ship were we once to
set to work to reach that land.”</p>

<p>“If I really thought it Utopia,” said the General,
stroking his moustache, “I would beg you to land me
at once, so eager am I to witness the condition of a
people living under a form of government the like of
which, for wisdom, humanity, and availability, is not to
be met with in any other part of the world. But it
<i>may</i> be Laputa, as you suggested.”</p>

<p>“Or Lilliput,” said Mr. Holland; whereupon the
actor, perceiving that a joke was playing at his expense,
scowled dramatically at the bank of cloud, and muttered,
that, for his part, when he asked a civil question he
usually looked for a truthful answer.</p>

<p>Just then a voice forward shouted out, “A sail on
the lee bow!”</p>

<p>There is always something exciting in this cry at
sea. Storms and calms grow wearisome after a bit, but
the interest that clusters about a vessel met on the
broad deep never loses its freshness. The captain went
for his telescope, and, after a brief inspection, announced
the vessel to be a large barque going the same road as
themselves. Mrs. Ashton asked leave to look through
the telescope, and a good deal of coquettish bye-play
took place; for, first she shut both eyes, and then she
couldn’t see at all; and then she shut the eye that looked
through the telescope, and, keeping the other open,
declared that she could see better without the glass.
Then the telescope wouldn’t keep steady; so Mr. St.
Aubyn went upon his knees and begged her to use his
shoulder for a rest. At last, after an infinity of trouble,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and when the cramp was just beginning to seize the
actor’s legs, she obtained a glimpse of the barque as it
swept through the field of the glass, and owned herself
delighted and satisfied.</p>

<p>The “Meteor” came up with the stranger hand
over fist, keeping to windward of her; and soon she
was no farther than a mile off, a big hull high in the
water, bare and black, with round bows and a square
stern. They hoisted the ensign on board the “Meteor,”
but the barque showed no colours.</p>

<p>“Some sour North Countryman, I reckon,” said
Captain Steel. “She has a Sunderland cut.”</p>

<p>She was under full sail, but just when the “Meteor”
got abreast of her, she clewed her royals up, down came
the flying and outer jibs, and the topgallant yards.</p>

<p>“What is she afraid of?” exclaimed Captain Steel,
gazing at her curiously.</p>

<p>You could see the pigmy figures of the men clambering
up the rigging, and presently down fell the topsail
yards and up went more figures, and the spars were
dotted with heads. Anything more picturesque than
this vessel&mdash;her black hull rolling majestically, her
white sails vanishing even as you watched them, her
rigging marked against the cloudy sky, the sense of the
noisy activity on board of her, of which no faintest echo
stole across the water, and all between, the tumbling
cloud-coloured waters&mdash;cannot be imagined. The crew
of the “Meteor” watched her with curiosity; but she
now fell rapidly astern, and in a short time could be
seen clearly only by the telescope, which Captain Steel
held to his eye, speculating upon her movements.</p>

<p>The dinner-bell rang. It was now the first dog-watch.
Thompson, the second mate, came on deck, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
passengers went to dinner. The sunlight had a watery
gleam in it as the lengthening rays fell upon the skylight,
and Holdsworth’s eyes constantly wandered to the
sails, which were visible through the glass. The skipper
was in high humour, and during dinner laughed at the
barque they had passed for shortening sail under a blue
sky.</p>

<p>“I’ll wager a hat,” he exclaimed, “that she’s commanded
by a Scotchman, even if she don’t hail from a
North British port. I don’t mean to say that your
Scotchman’s a timid man, but he’s unco’ thoughtful.
My first skipper was a Sawney, and every night, as
regularly as the second dog-watch came round, it was
‘In royals and flying-jib, and a single reef in the mizzen-top-sail.’”</p>

<p>“But there must be some reason for the barque furling
her sails,” said the General.</p>

<p>“From his point of view, no doubt, sir. You have
seen what the weather has been all the afternoon?”</p>

<p>“The wind is dropping, sir,” said Holdsworth, looking
through the skylight.</p>

<p>He had an uneasy expression in his eyes, and he
frequently glanced at the skipper; but etiquette of a
very severe kind prohibited him from imparting his
misgivings of a change, in the face of the skipper’s
manifest sense of security.</p>

<p>“It may freshen after sunset,” rejoined the skipper.
“Mr. Holland, the pleasure of a glass of wine.”</p>

<p>The conversation drifted into other channels. Mrs.
Ashton gave an account of a country ball she had
attended a week or two before she left England, and
described the dress she wore on that occasion, appealing
often to her husband to aid her memory, and riveting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the attention of Mr. St. Aubyn. Then the General
talked of the garrison-towns he had visited, and paid
some handsome compliments to the British army, and to
English society in general. Mrs. Tennent, seated on
the captain’s right hand, with her boy at her side,
listened to without joining in the conversation.</p>

<p>Holdsworth’s eyes roamed incessantly through the
skylight.</p>

<p>It happened presently that the General, in speaking
of the beauty of English inland scenery, mentioned the
county in which Southbourne was situated, and instanced
in particular the country around Hanwitch, a town lying
not half a dozen miles from Southbourne. Holdsworth
pricked his ears, and joined in the conversation. He
had reason to remember Hanwitch. One of the happiest
days he had spent, during the three months he had been
ashore, was that in which he had driven Dolly over to
that town, and dined in the queer little hotel that
fronted a piece of river-scenery as beautiful as any that
is to be found up the Thames.</p>

<p>Whilst he and the General talked, the skipper argued
with Mr. St. Aubyn on the merits of the English as a
paying people. St. Aubyn declared that the English
public, taken in the aggregate, was a mean public, rarely
liberal, and then liberal in wrong directions, supporting
quack institutions, responding to quack appeals, and
ignoring true excellence, especially histrionic excellence.
Both grew warm; then Mr. Holland joined in. He
sent the discussion wandering from the point, and in
stepped Mr. Ashton.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the decanters went round, the cuddy
grew dark, and the negro was looking at the steward
for orders to light the swinging lamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Hark!</p>

<p>A loud cry from the deck, followed by a sudden rush
of feet, and the ship heeled over&mdash;over&mdash;yet over!</p>

<p>The women shrieked; the skylight turned black;
plates, decanters, cutlery, glass, rolled from the table
and fell with quick crashes. The decks fore and aft
echoed with loud calls. You could hear the water
gurgling in the lee port-holes. A keen blue gleam
flashed upon the skylight; but if thunder followed the
lightning it was inaudible amid the wild and continuous
shrieking of the wind.</p>

<p>The skipper and Holdsworth scrambled to the
companion-ladder and gained the deck. In a trice they
saw what had happened. The ship, with all sails set,
had been taken aback.</p>

<p>Away to windward, in the direction directly contrary
to where the wind had been blowing before dinner, the
sky was livid, flinging an early night upon the sea, and
sending forth a tempest of wind that tore the water into
shreds of foam. The whole force of the hurricane was
upon the ship’s canvas, which lay backed against the
masts, and the vessel lay on her beam-ends, her masts
making an angle of forty degrees with the horizon.</p>

<p>The confusion was indescribable. Every halliard
had been let go; but the yards were jammed by the
sails, and would not descend. The clew-lines were
manned, but the sheets would not stir an inch through
the blocks. Nor was the worst of the squall, tempest,
hurricane, whatever it might be, upon them yet; that
livid pall of cloud which the lightning was seaming with
zigzag fire was still to come, and with it the full fury
its scowling aspect portended.</p>

<p>“My God!” thundered the skipper to the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
mate, who stood white, cowed, and apparently helpless,
“what have you brought us into?”</p>

<p>The wheel was jammed hard a-starboard, but the
ship lay like a log, broadside on to the wind, her masts
bowed almost on a level with the water.</p>

<p>“Haul! for your lives, men! haul!” shrieked the
skipper frantically to the men, who appeared paralysed
by the sudden catastrophe, and stood idly with the clew-lines
and reef tackles passed along them.</p>

<p>Holdsworth, half-way up the weather-poop ladder,
his head above the bulwarks, saw sooner than the
captain what was about to happen.</p>

<p>“Crowd to windward, all hands!” he roared. There
was no time to say more; the great broad, livid cloud
was upon them even whilst Holdsworth sang out the
command; the men held their breath&mdash;unless the masts
went the vessel was doomed.</p>

<p>Crash! A noise of wood shivered into splinters, of
flogging ropes and sails thundering their tatters upon
the wind; the fore and main masts went as you would
break a clay-pipe stem across your knee&mdash;the first, just
below the top, the other clean off at the deck; and the
huge mass of spars, ropes, and sails lay quivering and
rolling alongside&mdash;a portion on deck, but the greater
bulk of them in the water&mdash;grinding into the vessel’s
side as if she had grounded upon a shoal of rocks.</p>

<p>The ship righted, and then another crash; away
went the mizzen-topmast, leaving the spanker and cross-jack
set. The wind caught these sails and swept the
ship’s head round right in the eye of the storm, and off
she drove to leeward, disabled, helpless&mdash;dragging her
shattered spars with her, like something living its torn
and mangled limbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no situation in the whole range of the
misfortunes which may befall a ship at sea more critical
than the one the “Meteor” was now in. The sea was
rising quickly and leaping high over the ship’s bows,
pouring tons of water in upon the decks (the weight of
the wreck alongside preventing the vessel from rising
to the waves), and carrying whatever had become unlashed&mdash;casks,
spare spars, and the like&mdash;aft to the
cuddy front, against which they were launched with a
violence that broke the windows, and soon promised to
demolish the woodwork.</p>

<p>But the worst part of the business was&mdash;the action
of the sea set the spars in the water and the hull of the
ship rolling against each other, and the thump, thump,
thump of the bristly wreck against the vessel’s side sent
a hollow undertone through the hooting of the tempest
that was awful to hear.</p>

<p>Though the mizzen-mast still stood, the weight of
the other masts in falling had severely wrenched it, and
it literally rocked in its bed to the swaying of the great
spanker-boom. Add to all this the midnight darkness
in the air, which the flashes of lightning only served to
deepen by the momentary and ghastly illumination they
cast.</p>

<p>Yet, if the ship was not to be dragged to destruction,
it was imperative that she should be freed, and freed at
once, from the ponderous incumbrance of the wreck that
ground against her side. The captain had shouted himself
hoarse, and was no longer to be heard. But now
Holdsworth made himself audible in tones that rose
above the gale like trumpet-blasts.</p>

<p>“We must clear the wreck or founder! All hands
out with their knives and cut away everything!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>A comprehensive order that must be literally obeyed.</p>

<p>“Carpenter!” he roared.</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” came a voice from the main-deck.</p>

<p>Holdsworth sprang in the direction of the voice:
shouted again, and the man was at his side.</p>

<p>“Quick! Where’s your tool chest? Bear a hand,
now!”</p>

<p>The two men fought their way through the water
that came drenching and flying over the forecastle, to
the boatswain’s berth, which the carpenter shared; and
in a few moments returned staggering aft with their
arms full of tools, which they thrust into the hands of
the men. Holdsworth seized an adze; the carpenter
another; and to it fell all hands, feeling for the ropes
and then letting drive at them.</p>

<p>The mere occupation heartened the men, who worked
with a will, bursting into encouraging cheers from time
to time and calling to each other incessantly. The
lightning was so far useful that it enabled them to obtain
glimpses of the progress they made. The starboard
shrouds lay across the deck, from bulwark to bulwark,
like bridges; these were the first that were dealt with.
They kept the wreck close alongside, and the strain
upon them was enormous. Whilst Holdsworth and the
carpenter hacked, they repeatedly called to a few of the
men whose zeal kept them working on the lee side,
though their figures could not be seen, to stand clear,
wisely guessing that after a few of the shrouds had been
severed, the whole would part like a rope-yarn: and
this happened. One final blow divided a shroud and
left the weight upon a few others, which were unequal
to support it; and as they flew a loud shriek rose; a
man had been caught by the flying shrouds round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
body and whirled overboard like dust. But in the
darkness none could tell who the messmate was that
had lost his life.</p>

<p>The parting of these shrouds released the wreck from
the ship’s side, and it drifted some fathoms away. The
horrible grinding sounds ceased; but still the masts and
yards, which the lightning disclosed seething in the
water, black, ugly, and as dangerous as a lee-shore, were
attached to the hull by a network of rope, all which
must be severed. The knives of the men cut and hacked
in all directions; and first here and then there, and
sometimes as if crashing in half-a-dozen places at once,
the adze wielded by Holdsworth was to be heard.</p>

<p>The last shroud was at length severed, the last rope
parted; the hull, drifting faster than the dead weight
of wreck, fell astern of the horrible incumbrance, and
the next flash of lightning showed the water boiling
round the black spars ahead.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Holdsworth; but the men,
wearied and faint after their long and great struggle,
and sickened by the shriek of their perishing comrade,
whose cry still sounded in their ears, answered the
encouraging shout faint-heartedly.</p>

<p>The ocean was still a black and howling wilderness,
and the vessel plunged and rolled, and trembled in the
jumping seas, with her head right in the wind’s eye, and
the water pouring over her in sheets of undulating fire.
The water had stove in the cuddy front, and was washing
in tons down into the steerage. What they had
now to do was to furl the cross-jack; aft came the men
and clewed the sail up; on which the vessel fell broadside
to the wind and rolled her bulwarks under water.</p>

<p>To furl the cross-jack was a job full of peril; but, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the thing was to be done at all, it was to be done by a
<i>coup de main</i>. Holdsworth, crying to the hands to follow
him, sprang up the port mizzen rigging. Half-a-dozen
went up after him, the rest skulked in the darkness,
and stood holding their breath, expecting every moment
the crash that should fling the men aloft into the sea.
No glimpse of the brave fellows was to be obtained;
nothing but the flapping outline of the white sail could
be seen; the mast creaked harshly; but from time to
time the men’s voices could be heard even above the
roar of the tempest, the groaning of the ship, and the
rolling of spare casks, a sheep-pen which had become
unlashed, and other things about the waist and quarter-deck;
and slowly the faint spaces of thundering canvas
vanished in the darkness, and were securely stowed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the hands about the poop had been sent
to man the pumps. The carpenter had sounded the
well and reported three feet of water in the hold.</p>

<p>“She must be tight, sir! I am sure she is tight,
sir! She has shipped the water that’s in her through
the mast-coat of the main-mast!” the skipper shouted
to Holdsworth, who stood, panting from his exertions
aloft, close against the mizzen-mast, that he might
judge what chance there was of its standing.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the wheel was hard a-starboard, and
the gale was now upon the ship’s quarter, the huge
waves breaking under her counter and sending her
wildly yawing forward. Had there been daylight, they
could have rigged up a jury foresail on the stump of
the fore-mast, which would have served to keep her
before the wind; but nothing could be done in the overwhelming
darkness except to keep the pumps at work.</p>

<p>But she was riding more easily now, and shipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
fewer seas; the port bulwark just abaft the gangway
had been crushed to a level with the deck by the fall
of the main-mast, and offered a wide aperture for the
escape of the water, so that the main-deck, where the
hands worked the pumps, was practicable.</p>

<p>Furiously as it still blew, it was evident that the
storm was abating; there were rifts in the clouds,
through which, here and there, a pale star glimmered
for an instant, and was then swallowed up.</p>

<p>It was now five bells (half-past ten); the skipper
ordered rum to be served out to the men, who were
wet through to the skin, and fagged to death by their
extraordinary exertions. The carpenter sounded the
well again, and reported an increase of three inches in
the depth of water. This was a terrible announcement,
and proved beyond a doubt that the ship was leaking,
though the crew were kept in ignorance of the report,
that they might not be disheartened.</p>

<p>At six bells the clouds had broken into huge black
groups, with spaces of clear sky between, and the wind
was lulling as rapidly as it had risen.</p>

<p>The ship was still buoyant enough to rise easily over
the seas; but anything more forlorn than her appearance,
as it was disclosed by the dim light that fell from
the rifts among the clouds, cannot be imagined.</p>

<p>The fore-mast stood like a black and lightning-shattered
tree; the jib-boom hung in two pieces from
the bowsprit; where the main-mast had stood were
some huge jagged splinters; and aft towered the
mizzen-mast, with the cross-jack swinging to the roll of
the ship, the spanker with its peak halliards gone, and
the whole picture of it completing the unutterable air
of desolation presented by the storm-shattered vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>At eight bells the carpenter reported no increase of
the water in the hold, which cheering intimation the
captain delivered to the men from the break of the poop,
who received it with a faint cheer.</p>

<p>The pumps had been relieved three times, and now
the port watch was at them, making the water bubble
on to the deck, where it was washed to and fro, and
poured in streams through the scupper-holes.</p>

<p>At one o’clock, Holdsworth, who had been on deck
since a quarter to seven, went below to put on dry
clothes; and as he was leaving his cabin to return on
deck he met Mrs. Tennent. Her face was very pale in
the light of the swinging lamp, and she stood at her
cabin door, by the handle of which she supported herself.</p>

<p>“Are we not in great danger, Mr. Holdsworth?” she
whispered, in a tone of deep excitement.</p>

<p>“The worst is passed, I hope,” answered Holdsworth
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Do not be afraid of telling me the truth. I can
be brave for my child’s sake. If real danger should
come, Mr. Holdsworth, will you remember him? Will
you be near him in that moment?”</p>

<p>“We won’t talk of danger yet, Mrs. Tennent. We
have had an ugly bout of it, but the daylight is coming,
and then we shall be more comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Many times,” she exclaimed, “I thought we were
sinking! O God! what a horrible night this has
been! I heard the water rushing past the cabin door,
and I tried to reach the deck, but was too faint to carry
my child, and I could not leave him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see we are still afloat,” Holdsworth
answered cheerily. “Depend upon it, we will do our
best to save the ship. Take my advice and lie down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and get some sleep. This water here,” pointing to the
cuddy-deck, “means nothing; a swab will put that to
rights. The morning is coming, and you are sailing
under a skipper who knows what he is about.”</p>

<p>He waved his hand cordially, and left her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All through that long night the hands stuck to the
pumps, but the water gained upon them inch by inch,
and when the morning broke at last, the vessel was deep
and heavy, rolling sluggishly, and leaking fast.</p>

<p>The sun was a welcome sight to the poor fagged
seamen. Up he sprang, flushing the universe with a
pink splendour, and dispersing the heavy clouds which
hung in clusters about his rising-point.</p>

<p>Up to that time there had been a fresh breeze blowing,
the dregs, so to speak, of the storm that had dismantled
the ship; but this lulled as the sun rose, the
sea smoothed out its turbulent waves, and a day filled
with the promise of calm and beauty broke on a scene
as desolate as any the heart can conceive.</p>

<p>One of the watches was in the forecastle; half the
other watch on deck was at the pumps, the monotonous
sounds of which had been echoing many hours, together
with the gushing of water surging over the decks, and
pouring in streams from the ship’s sides.</p>

<p>The vessel was now no more than a log on the water;
not a shred of canvas, with the exception of the mutilated
spanker upon her, her port bulwarks crushed, her
fore-mast a stump, her decks exhibiting a scene of wild
disorder&mdash;loose spars that had been washed from forward
encumbering the entrance of the cuddy; the cuddy
front battered to pieces, spare casks piled tumultuously
about the poop-ladders, and the long-boat, lashed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>tween
the galley and the fore-mast, and which had held
some of the live stock, full of water and drowned sheep.
On the port side, the severed shrouds, which had supported
the masts, trailed their black lengths in the sea;
and all about the starboard side were the fragments of
ropes and stays hacked and torn to pieces; while the
port main-chains had received a wrench that had torn
the bolts out of the ship’s side, and left the irons standing
out.</p>

<p>As yet none of the passengers had made their appearance.
The captain had brought a chart from his cabin
and unrolled it upon the skylight, and stood with his
finger upon it, calculating his whereabouts by yesterday’s
reckoning, and waiting for Holdsworth to return from
the hold, which he and the carpenter were exploring
for the leak.</p>

<p>The swell, which was heavy, surged against the ship’s
sides; but her buoyancy was gone, she hardly moved
to the pressure.</p>

<p>Presently Holdsworth came out of the hold, wet and
exhausted, followed by the carpenter in worse plight.</p>

<p>“Well?” exclaimed the captain, in a subdued but
eager voice.</p>

<p>“I am afraid it is a hopeless case, sir. She’s leaking
in a dozen different places.”</p>

<p>“The worst leak is just amidships,” said the carpenter.
“It’s under the water in the hold. You can
hear it bubbling, but there’s no getting at it.”</p>

<p>“What soundings have you got?”</p>

<p>“Eleven feet, sir!”</p>

<p>“Good God!” cried the skipper; “that’s an increase
of a foot and a half since seven bells.”</p>

<p>“We had better look to the boats, sir,” said Holdsworth,
scanning the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t talk of the boats yet, sir!” panted the skipper.
“Clap some backstays on to the fore-mast and
turn to and rig up the spare staysail.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir,” answered Holdsworth, and went forward
to call all hands and make what sail they could
upon the stump of the fore-mast, whilst the skipper
walked passionately to and fro, perfectly conscious of
the hopelessness of their situation, but determined to
blind his eyes to it.</p>

<p>The first among the passengers to come on deck was
the General, who stood transfixed by the spectacle of
the wreck. He and some of the others had attempted
during the night to leave their berths and find out the
reason of the uproar that was going on over their heads,
but had been literally blown back again the moment
they showed their noses above the hatchway; and none
of them, with the exception of Mrs. Tennent, having
had an opportunity of speaking to either the captain or
Holdsworth, they were all in perfect ignorance that the
vessel was actually a wreck.</p>

<p>Whilst the General stood gasping and staring up
aloft in search of the majestic masts and sails that had
reared their graceful heights when he was last on deck,
he was joined by Mr. St. Aubyn and Mr. Holland, both
of whom turned pale with amazement and fear.</p>

<p>Then all three of them ran up to the captain.</p>

<p>“Oh, tell us what has happened? What will become
of us? Are we sinking?” cried the actor.</p>

<p>“Where are the masts gone? Is it possible that we
can ever reach America in this condition?” gasped Mr.
Holland.</p>

<p>“Captain, we seem to be in a frightful mess! Why,
we are foundering, sir!” exclaimed the General, rolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his eyes over the sea and then fixing them upon the
captain.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen! gentlemen!” returned the skipper, extending
his hands, “pray leave me! You distract me
by your questions.”</p>

<p>“Are we in danger?” implored Mr. St. Aubyn.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; can’t you see?” answered the skipper
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” stammered Mr. St. Aubyn, turning
deadly pale.</p>

<p>“It is possible!” cried the skipper scornfully. “But
I hope you are not going to be afraid, sir. Look over
the break of the poop and you’ll see the men pumping
for their lives. Danger is one thing, and drowning is
another. I beg, sir, that you will control your fears.
Panics are easily created, and you will remember, please,
that we have women among us.”</p>

<p>Saying which he walked some paces away. Mr. St.
Aubyn burst into tears; Mr. Holland gazed around him
with an air of stupefaction; the General followed the
skipper.</p>

<p>“Is our position really serious?”</p>

<p>“Yes, General; the ship’s bottom is leaky fore and
aft.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean to do?”</p>

<p>“Keep her afloat as long as I can. And now will
you do me a service? Go and clap that snivelling actor
on the back and put some heart in him. One coward
makes many, and this is no time for any man on board
my ship who values his life at one farthing to lose his
pluck.”</p>

<p>By this time the hands forward had lashed a block
on the stump of the fore-mast, and run up a spare staysail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Holdsworth then came aft to the poop. The captain
called him to the skylight, and they hung together
over the chart, calculating their neighbourhood, and
devising expedients in subdued tones. The men who
were far enough forward to see them as they stood together
on the poop eyed them curiously, and held muttering
conversations together, some of them going to the
ship’s side and looking over.</p>

<p>It was felt by every man among them that the vessel
was sinking; and those who worked the pumps plied
them languidly, as though understanding the fruitlessness
of their labour.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tennent came on deck with her boy and stood
near Holdsworth, asking no questions, but with an
expression on her face that plainly showed her conscious
of the danger and prepared for the worst. Soon afterwards
came Mrs. Ashton, who shrieked out when she
beheld the dismasted hull, and clung convulsively to her
husband. Her maid followed her, shivering, cowed,
with big eyes staring everywhere like a madwoman’s.</p>

<p>Then a dead silence fell upon the ship, disturbed
only by the languid clanking of the pumps and the fall
of the continuous streams of water over the ship’s sides.</p>

<p>It was now half-past eight o’clock. Not a breath of
air rippled the surface of the sea, which rose and sank
to a deep and voluminous under-swell. Some heavy
clouds hung motionless in the blue sky, from one of
which a shower of rain was falling about a mile off,
arching a little brilliant rainbow upon the water.</p>

<p>Presently Holdsworth advanced to the poop-rail and
sang out to the carpenter to sound the well. This was
done, and the report showed that the leak was gaining
fast upon the pumps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>On this announcement all heart went out of the captain
like a flash, and left him silent and spiritless.</p>

<p>He rallied, went to Holdsworth’s side and called out:
“Belay that pumping there! Boatswain, send all hands
aft to the quarter-deck.”</p>

<p>The sound of the pumping ceased, the men came aft
in groups and stood in a crowd.</p>

<p>Some of them were bearded, some quite young; their
attire was various but always picturesque: here a red
shirt, there white, here blue serge, there coarse canvas,
many with bare brown arms ringed with tattoo-marks;
some in sea-boots, some with naked feet. The bright
sun gleamed upon their upturned faces, pale for want of
sleep and with the intense weariness of their long and
heavy labours. There was no want of respect suggested
by any of them; but, on the contrary, there was a rough
and sympathetic deference in their manner and gaze as
they fixed their eyes on their white-haired skipper and
listened to his speech, which he delivered in a voice
that now and then faltered.</p>

<p>“My men, I had hoped to keep our poor old hooker
afloat by manning the pumps day and night and head
for home, which, with a breeze astern of us, we might
have reached even in the trim the gale last night has
put us in. But I find that the water is gaining upon
us faster than we can pump it out, and it’s not my intention
to fag you with useless work. But in this sea
the hull is likely to float for some hours yet; so we
shall have plenty of time to get the boats out and do
the best we can for our lives. You are most of you
Englishmen, and those who are not are all brave fellows,
and no man can be better than that, let him hail from
what port he may: so I can depend upon you turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to and obeying orders quietly. There are thirty-four
souls aboard of us and four boats; there’s room for
thirteen in the long-boat, and for seven apiece in the
quarter-boats. I’ll take charge of the long-boat, your
chief mate of the pinnace, and the second mate and
boatswain will take the others. There’s no hurry, and
there must be no confusion. Let a dozen hands man
the pumps, the rest go to breakfast and then relieve the
pumps. Then tumble aft, get the long-boat launched,
and do the best we can for ourselves; and may God
preserve us! Amen.”</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this speech the men raised a
cheer, the boatswain’s pipe shrilled, clang went the
pumps again, and the quarter-deck was deserted.</p>

<p>The captain turned to the passengers.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, these are ugly straits for
me to have brought you into, and I would that God in
His mercy had ordained it otherwise. I have been forty
years at sea, and the like of this has never befallen me
before. But that’s no matter. I’ll take care to do my
duty by you to the last. We have got enough boats to
accommodate us all comfortably; the weather promises
fair, and it’s odds if every one of us isn’t snug and safe
on board some ship before to-night; for we’re right in
the track of homeward-bound ships from the United
States. Some of you will come with me, and some go
along with my chief officer, who has worked nobly for
us all, and who’ll work as nobly right away through for
those who are with him whilst the life is in his body.
Ladies, keep up your courage; for a sinking ship is a
small matter when you’ve got good boats, and are with
men who know how to handle ’em. We’ll go below now
and make as good a breakfast as we can; we’ll then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
provision the boats and put off, as sure as our hearts
can make us that God’s eye, which is everywhere, will
not lose sight of us.”</p>

<p>There were some murmurs, and then a silence, which
Mrs. Ashton broke by bursting into a passion of tears.
When she was in some measure calmed, the General
said:</p>

<p>“Fellow-passengers, will you unite with me in a
prayer to our merciful God for His protection?”</p>

<p>The men took off their hats, but the captain exclaimed:</p>

<p>“General, there are hands for’ard who might like to
join us. We should give them the chance.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth went to the forecastle, and presently
returned with the whole ship’s company following him.
The hands at the pump ceased their work to gather
round the capstan, and the passengers attended the
skipper in a body to the quarter-deck. The old General
stood in the midst of the crowd and knelt&mdash;an example
followed by the rest.</p>

<p>There was something too sacred in the nature of the
extemporaneous prayer offered up by the General to
make it proper for me to write it down here; but its
effect was deeply impressive. Noble, beyond the power
of words to describe, was the spectacle of the fine old
American, bare-headed and kneeling, his trembling hands
clasped, his kindly, honest face upturned to the skies,
breathing forth in broken tones an earnest entreaty that
God, in His infinite mercy, would look down upon His
servants now and grant them His all-powerful protection
in this their hour of danger and suffering. Equally
affecting was the spectacle of the men&mdash;some with hands
clasped before their faces, some kneeling with reverently-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>bowed
heads, some gazing with earnest eyes upon the
petitioner, and some even weeping&mdash;not unmanly tears&mdash;those
who wept were among the bravest. The widow
knelt with her arms about her child’s neck, in an attitude
both shielding and imploring. The husband and
wife prayed hand-in-hand.</p>

<p>Overhead shone the joyous sun; the long and
polished swell surged against the sluggish vessel’s side;
and amidst the tones of the old General and the solemn
murmur of those who followed his words, you might
hear the gurgling of the water in the hold, and feel the
ship’s growing weight and helplessness in the heavy and
weary rolls she gave to the movement of the sea.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />

<span class="smaller">IN THE BOATS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>By twelve o’clock they had baled the long-boat out and
got her over the ship’s side, a task of no small difficulty,
since, the main-mast being gone, they had no means of
slinging her. The other boats were also lowered, each
with a hand in her, and hung in a group about the port
side of the ship, where the bulwarks were smashed.</p>

<p>Each boat was properly supplied with mast, sail, and
oars; also with water, biscuits, some rum in bottles, etc.
They looked mere cookie-shells alongside the great hull,
and it seemed difficult to realise that they would sustain
among them the weight of the crowd of men who stood
by ready to jump into them.</p>

<p>The ship was settling fast. They had left off pumping
her some time since, and she had now sunk a great
hole under her port fore-chains to a level with the water,
which gushed in like a cascade.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton was the first to be handed out of the
ship. She screamed and hung back, and threw her
hands out to her husband; but the men, raising her
firmly in their arms, offering her the while certain rough
and hearty encouragements, passed her over the ship’s
side to the sailors in the boats, who deposited her in
the long-boat. The widow, at her own request, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
assigned to Holdsworth’s boat. They handed her boy
over first, and then she followed and seated herself in
the stern-sheets, holding her child tightly.</p>

<p>Then rose a cry of “Bear a hand! the ship will
founder!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ashton’s maid was passed out quickly, and then
the passengers; the actor and the General getting into
Holdsworth’s boat, the others into the long-boat. After
this, the seamen, feeling the imminence of the danger,
tumbled rapidly into the boats; and then Holdsworth
quitted the ship, followed by the captain.</p>

<p>“Shove off!” shouted the boatswain, who commanded
one of the quarter-boats.</p>

<p>Out flashed the oars; the boats parted and stood
aloof from the hull at a distance of about three hundred
feet.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the mingled emotions of
dismay, curiosity, and breathless suspense with which
the men awaited the sinking of the hull. There was
not a soul among them who felt privileged to depart
until the vessel, so noble once, so desolate and broken
now, had sunk to her long home in the deep Atlantic.
Something absolutely of human pathos that appealed to
the heart, as the distress of a living thing might, seemed
mixed up in the aspect of unutterable desolation she
presented, the more defined and keen because of the
mocking joyousness of the sunlight that streamed over
her, and the fair and azure surface of the sea on which
she rested. Her figure-head, uninjured by the gale&mdash;as
perfect a piece of workmanship as ever graced a vessel’s
bows&mdash;might, by no violent fantasy, have been deemed
the spirit of the ship poising herself an instant ere she
soared towards the sky. The two sails upon her flapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
hollowly to her roll, and once there came from her
silent deck a sound as of a bell being struck, which
filled the listening sailors with awe, and set them bending
superstitious glances in search of the Shadow that
was tolling the ship’s funeral knell.</p>

<p>All on a sudden the hull lurched in the direction
of the boats and exposed her sloping decks. “She’s
going now!” cried one of the men. This was true.
Down sank her stern slowly, so slowly that many
seconds passed ere her stern-windows were on a level
with the water. She righted, and her bows, high
raised, pointed the shattered jib-boom aloft, as though
in her last agony she raised her mangled limbs to
heaven. She then sank stern foremost, the deepest
tragical dignity attending her descent: the silence
unbroken, save by the sullen gurgling and bubbling of
the water forcing itself through her decks. Her stern
disappeared; then her bows stood black on the water;
they vanished, and the fore-mast with the sail upon it
alone remained visible. Lower and lower these crept,
but still it was possible to trace the undulating outline
of the hull in the clear water. The sponge-like sail
sucked up the water quicker than it sank, and arched a
brown shadow upon its snow; then the jagged top of
the fore-mast only was to be seen; this vanished, and
the boats were left alone upon the mighty surface of the
deep.</p>

<p>A deep silence prevailed among the men while she
was sinking; and not for some moments after she had
disappeared did the spell upon them break, and a long
and tremulous sigh escaped them.</p>

<p>Then the captain’s voice in the long-boat was heard:</p>

<p>“Mr. Holdsworth, our course is east-north-east. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
boat has a compass aboard of her. Now, my men, up
with your masts; we may get a breeze before sun-down.
And, meanwhile, out with your oars and make what
way we can towards the old country!”</p>

<p>The stout-hearted fellows answered with a cheer; in
all four boats they shipped the masts; out went the
oars, and the water bubbled round the stems.</p>

<p>The men were right to cheer. God knows they
needed what encouragement each other’s voice could
give them.</p>

<p>What pen shall describe the overwhelming sense of
the immensity of the sea, now that its surface could be
touched by the hand&mdash;its huge presence so close!
That sense alone was a weight that oppressed the hearts
of the passengers like death. The height of a large
ship from the edge of the water implanted a habit of
security; but here, they overhung the deep by an arm’s
length, and near enough to see their own pale faces
mirrored in the green abyss from which they were
separated by planks not much stouter than the sole of
a boot.</p>

<p>There were in Holdsworth’s boat: himself, Mrs.
Tennent and her boy, Mr. St. Aubyn, the General,
and two seamen&mdash;Winyard and Johnson; in all, seven
souls. The long-boat, in the distance, looked crowded;
but then she was the largest of the boats. Astern of
her rowed the boat commanded by the boatswain;
astern of Holdsworth’s, the boat commanded by Mr.
Thompson, the second mate.</p>

<p>There could be no purpose gained by rowing, for,
let them ply the oars as hard as they would, they could
not urge the heavy boats faster than three miles an
hour. Holdsworth steered for the long-boat, and pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>posed
to the captain that they should lay their oars in
and wait for a breeze; which was agreed to. The sun
shone hot upon the glassy sea, and the boats hoisted
their sails as a protection against the rays. And for ever
the men bent earnest and anxious glances round the
bare and polished horizon for a sail.</p>

<p>In Holdsworth’s boat the two seamen sat forward,
talking together in low voices; Mr. St. Aubyn reclined
with his back against the mast, glancing incessantly
about him with quick, scared eyes, but quite silent, as
though the novelty and horror of the situation was
more than his mind could receive, and he was labouring
to master it. The General’s face was placid, and even
hopeful. The widow, holding her son at her side, kept
her eyes bent downwards, and often her lips moved.</p>

<p>In the other boats the men talked, and often called
to one another. Their voices sounded forced and unreal
as the tones floated across the water, and in a strange
manner heightened the unspeakable sense of solitude
inspired by the boundless and tenantless deep.</p>

<p>For some time the little boy appeared to share in
the feelings which held all but the two sailors in
Holdsworth’s boat silent; but he presently grew restless,
and pulling his mother by the skirt, asked her in
a whisper when the ship was coming back to take them
on board again.</p>

<p>“Another ship will come and take us soon, pray
God, Louis,” answered the mother.</p>

<p>“But where is our ship, mamma?”</p>

<p>Holdsworth overheard the question, and answered in
his hearty, cheery manner:</p>

<p>“Look well about you, Louis, and, by-and-by, you
will see a tiny spot of white rise somewhere on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
clear circle,” pointing round the horizon, “and that will
be our ship coming to take us home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Holdsworth!” said the actor, in a faint
voice, “if the wind rises, will not the water get into our
boat and sink it?”</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it, sir. I am waiting for the
wind to rise. There is no chance of a rescue in this
calm.”</p>

<p>“Though we should be grateful for this calm,”
exclaimed the General, “for it has enabled us all to
leave the sinking ship in safety.”</p>

<p>“I have lost my all in that ship&mdash;all the money I
had in the world, and my clothes, and things that were
priceless to me,” moaned Mr. St. Aubyn.</p>

<p>The widow raised her head, and exclaimed, “I too
have lost much that was precious, and which no money
could ever purchase. But, so far, God has watched
over us and preserved our lives, and I can well spare
all else&mdash;all else&mdash;if He will but leave me this treasure.”
She wept as she bowed her head over her child.</p>

<p>“Let us not murmur, Mr. St. Aubyn,” said the
General softly, “but call upon Him who rebuked the
winds and waves in the sea of Galilee, and calmed them.
Have not we His disciples’ faith? He is in our midst,
watching over us, even as we sit now. This ocean is
but the symbol of His majesty and might: His servant
who will bear us safely on its bosom at its Lord’s command.
Our Saviour sleeps not, neither will He forsake
us. We forget Him when we yield to our fears.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for those words, sir,” said the man
named Johnson. “God don’t forget those who are at
sea any more than those who stop on shore. I have
been worse off nor this, sir, lashed to a raft for forty-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>eight
hours, and here I am to tell the story. Begging
your pardon, sir,” he added, touching his cap, and drawing
back respectfully.</p>

<p>By this time the boats had drifted some distance
apart; but the voices talking in them could still be
heard with the utmost clearness, so exquisite a vehicle
of sound is the smooth surface of water.</p>

<p>It was one o’clock by Holdsworth’s watch when they
beheld the horizon in the east darkening under what
resembled the shadow of a cloud, and the voice of a
man in the long-boat came across the water, crying,
“A breeze at last, my boys!”</p>

<p>It was a light breeze, and moved very slowly, but it
filled the sails and sent the boats rippling gently through
the water. As it came foul of the course the skipper
meant to take, they lay as close to it as they could;
and eyes were strained in its direction for the welcome
sail, some of them whispered, it might bring along with
it. Some white clouds came up, and as they soared
about the horizon, they so closely resembled the sails
of ships that even Holdsworth’s experienced eye was
deceived, and he gazed intently with a beating heart.</p>

<p>The breeze freshened, and the unequal sailing qualities
of the boats manifested themselves. The long-boat drew
ahead rapidly; Holdsworth’s came next; the other two
fell astern. The wind, though in reality light, seemed
tolerably strong, owing to the boats sailing close to it.
Holdsworth’s boat lay over, which terrified St. Aubyn,
and made him cling to the weather-gunwale.</p>

<p>“You’re afeard rather early, sir,” said one of the seamen&mdash;Winyard&mdash;sarcastically.</p>

<p>“The boat will turn over!” gasped the actor.</p>

<p>Indeed his fear and despair were pitiable, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
not only dulled his eyes, but pinched and thinned his
face as though he were fresh from a sick bed.</p>

<p>“Take a pull at this,” said Holdsworth, offering him
some rum, and heartily commiserating the man’s sufferings.
But St. Aubyn shook his head, and gazed with
distended eyes at the water, shivering repeatedly, and
sometimes talking to himself.</p>

<p>In order to let the hinder boats come up, the long-boat
ahead from time to time stopped her way by putting
her helm down, which example Holdsworth regularly
followed; and so they sailed throughout the whole afternoon,
the breeze remaining steady and the sea smooth.</p>

<p>The boat commanded by Holdsworth was about
twenty-seven feet long, with seven feet or thereabouts
of beam. There was a locker aft, which had been filled
with small bags of bread, as they call biscuits at sea;
and forward were one small and two large kegs of water,
and a tin pannikin to serve out the allowances with.
At the bottom of the boat was a set of gratings, meant
to keep the feet clear of any water that might be shipped,
with a well convenient to get at, and half a cocoa-nut-shell
with a handle let into it, to bale the boat with.
The boat was new, stoutly built, and rigged with a lug-sail.
A small compass had been put in her, and Holdsworth
had lashed it carefully to a thwart. This was
the only nautical instrument they had with them, and
unless they could guess their whereabouts, it would not,
after a time, be of much service.</p>

<p>They had during the afternoon ascertained the quantity
of provisions and water they carried, and discovered
that there was enough to last for about ten days, providing
each person had no more than two biscuits, and
a quarter full of the pannikin of water, a day. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
had also three bottles of rum. The first allowance was
served out by Holdsworth at five o’clock in the afternoon.
A biscuit was handed to each person; the little boy and
the two seamen ate theirs hungrily: the General and
Holdsworth nibbled only a portion of theirs: but Mrs.
Tennent and the actor ate nothing. The mother gave
half her biscuit to her boy, and put the other half in
her pocket for him to eat during the night. The actor
refused his allowance altogether, and Holdsworth returned
it to the bag he had taken it from.</p>

<p>All the other boats remained in sight; the long-boat
ahead, and the other two at unequal distances astern.
From time to time they encouraged each other by waving
their hats; and just before sunset some of the men in
the long-boat struck up a hymn, the chorus of which
stole faintly across the breeze, and mingled with the
bubbling play of the water round the boat’s bows.</p>

<p>The sun went down, branding the great ocean with
an angry glare; but nothing was visible upon either
horizon but the deceptive tail-ends of clouds rising or
dwindling. The breeze grew stronger as the darkness
crept on, and they lowered the sail and took a couple of
reefs in it, whilst there was light enough abroad for
them to see what they were about. They soon lost
sight of the other boats, and Holdsworth finding the
wind drawing ahead, put the boat round, judging that
the others would do so likewise.</p>

<p>Now, if at no other time, was the sense of the profound
helplessness of their position forced upon them.
It is easy to write and read of an open boat far out in
the Atlantic Ocean, and darkness around; but none save
those who have experienced the situation can realise all
the horror of it. Waves which would scarcely more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
than ripple against the sides of a ship, make a dangerous
sea for an open boat, and arch their seething heads
over her with a threat in every one of them of destruction.</p>

<p>But <i>the</i> overpowering sensation is the near presence
of the sea. Your feet are below its surface; your head
but an arm’s length above it. And you hear the quick
splash of the boat’s bows as she jumps awkwardly into
the hollows of the waves, wobbling as she goes forward
with jerks and many stoppages, while now and again
the sea chucks a handful of spray into your eyes as an
earnest of the way it means to deal with you presently,
when the wind has made it more angry.</p>

<p>The stars came out and shone placidly among the
clouds which were rolling away to the north-west.
There was a short quick sea, which made the boat dip
uncomfortably, and now and again whisked a sheet of
spray over the seamen who sat forward. But there was
more south than east in the breeze, which kept the
temperature of the night mild. The little boy fell
asleep in his mother’s arms; Mr. St. Aubyn reclined
against the mast, his arms folded, and his head drooping
on his breast, starting at intervals as the spray fell like
a shower of rain in the boat, but speedily relapsing again
into the sluggish or semi-unconscious state into which
he had fallen shortly after the sun had gone down.
The General and Holdsworth sometimes conversed.
Presently Winyard, turning his coat collar over his ears,
slipped under the thwart, where he coiled himself like a
cat, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>“I wish I could induce you to lie down, Mrs. Tennent,”
said Holdsworth. “My coat will make you a
capital pillow. I don’t want it indeed. I have slept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
on deck in my shirt-sleeves in colder nights than this.
I shan’t put the boat about again to-night if this wind
holds, and you will lie with your boy alongside of you
as snugly as possible on this seat.”</p>

<p>She thanked him, but said it would be useless for
her to lie down; she should not be able to sleep.</p>

<p>“You have eaten nothing all day,” said the General;
“you must not allow your strength to fail you. Pray
try to eat a little biscuit.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth handed her a biscuit, and she broke a
piece of it off and appeared to munch it; but in the
darkness they could not tell how little she ate.</p>

<p>No sign was to be seen of the other boats, although
once Holdsworth imagined he heard a voice halloing a
long way to windward. The boat’s head was now
pointing east-north-east; but she lay close to the wind
and made scarcely more than four knots an hour. The
jump of the sea deadened her way materially; but this
jump decreased as the night wore on, for the waves grew
longer, with steadier intermissions. At twelve o’clock,
Holdsworth, who was worn out by his long spell at the
helm, called to Johnson to awaken Winyard. Up
jumped the seaman from the bottom of the boat and
came aft. Holdsworth gave him the yoke-lines, and
bidding Johnson lie down and get some rest, seated
himself on the lee-side of the mast and scanned the sea
to right and left of him. The old General had fallen
asleep right along the thwart on which he sat, his face
buried in his arm. The boy slept soundly in his mother’s
arms, but whether she slumbered or not, Holdsworth
could not tell. Once Mr. St. Aubyn started up as from
a nightmare, muttered some broken sentences, and was
silent again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“Keep her close,” said Holdsworth to Winyard,
“and watch the seas.”</p>

<p>“You had best take some rest, sir. I can handle
the boat whilst you’re down.”</p>

<p>“No. I’ll wait until Johnson has had his nap.”</p>

<p>So passed two hours.</p>

<p>It was drawing near half-past two in the morning
when Winyard called, in a loud whisper:</p>

<p>“Master, isn’t that a ship to windward, there?”</p>

<p>No one in the boat heard him but Holdsworth. He
jumped up and peered into the starlit gloom ahead,
where, sure enough, the outline of a dark shadow could
be traced, though only by looking on one side of it.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a ship!” he answered hoarsely; “but
she’s too far to windward to hear our shouts. Have we
any lights aboard of us? Quick!”</p>

<p>He pulled the General, who leaped up, rubbing his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Have you any matches about you?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;what is it?”</p>

<p>“There’s a ship yonder! I could souse my handkerchief
in rum and set fire to it. Hi! Mr. St. Aubyn!
feel if you have a match in your pockets.” But the
actor answered with a stupefied stare, whereupon Holdsworth
searched his pockets without avail.</p>

<p>Johnson was awake, standing up in the bows, with
his arms lifted.</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy!” roared Holdsworth. One might have
thought the voice deep and powerful enough to have
carried twice the distance of that gliding shadow.</p>

<p>They waited breathlessly; but no sound was returned.</p>

<p>“Altogether, now!” shouted Holdsworth; “one,
two, three&mdash;ship ahoy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The united voices sounded like a shriek of death-agony
rising out of the ebony-coloured deep; but no
response was brought back by the wind.</p>

<p>“O God!” raved Winyard. “They’d see us if we
could only show a light!”</p>

<p>“She is running before the wind,” cried Johnson;
“she’s passing us!”</p>

<p>“Put your helm up!” roared Holdsworth. “We’ll
follow her. She may hear us when we get her to leeward.”</p>

<p>They let go the halliards, shook the reefs out of the
sail, and set it again, slackening the sheet far out. The
boat headed for the visionary shadow, which was fast
fading in the universal gloom, and the foam boiled under
and alongside of her.</p>

<p>“Altogether again!” sang out Holdsworth.</p>

<p>Once more went forth the loud, despairing chorus,
to be followed by silence. They might as well have
attempted to chase a cloud. Keen as the sailors’ eyes
were, they could no longer perceive the shadow.</p>

<p>“Never mind!” exclaimed Holdsworth, cheerily,
“there may be others near us; we’ll keep a sharp look-out.”</p>

<p>“She may fall in with one of the other boats,” said
Johnson, “and, maybe, she’ll cruise about to find us.”</p>

<p>The chill of disappointment passed, and they grew
hopeful. The mere fact of having sighted a ship imparted
a new encouragement.</p>

<p>“We should be in the track of outward-bounders,”
said Holdsworth. “Give us a hand here, Johnson, to
take these reefs in. Bring her close again, Winyard.
Pray God we shall be talking of this night on a ship’s
deck by noon to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The little boy, who had been awakened by the halloing
of the men, shivered, crept closer to his mother’s
side, and fell asleep again.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SECOND DAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Mr. Holdsworth,” said the General, “will you not
let me watch whilst you get some sleep? You have
been up now for nearly three nights running, and I beg
you to consider the preciousness of your life to us all.”</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you, General. I’ll do as you
ask me. Johnson, come aft and relieve Winyard here.
Keep a sharp look-out, my lads, and wake me up if the
breeze freshens.” He seated himself in the bottom of
the boat, rested his head upon a thwart, and in a few
moments was fast asleep.</p>

<p>A hush fell upon the boat which nothing broke but
the quick angry sousing of the bows as the boat fell
with her short length into the trough of the sea. The
widow had fallen asleep at last, and leaned against
Johnson, who steered, whilst her boy slumbered with
his head on her lap. The sailor sat motionless for fear
of waking her, calling once in a whisper to Winyard to
come aft and look at the little ’un, and tell him if he
thought that God would let such innocence be drowned.</p>

<p>“He’s the image of my little Bill,” answered Winyard,
stooping his bearded face low that he might see
the child’s features. “I’m glad the poor lady’s sleeping.
Keep steady, Dick, or you’ll wake her. She ain’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
tasted a mossil of food all this blessed day, and it ’ud
cut me to the heart to see the little ’un left without a
mother.”</p>

<p>“Ay, and so it would me, Harry. May be we’ll
sight a ship to-morrow. I’ve got my old woman to keep
ashore, and I guess, when rent-time comes, she won’t
know what to do, unless I get back.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had some ’baccy with me. Ain’t got a
bit in all my pockets. I wonder where t’other boats
have got to?”</p>

<p>The conversation, which had been carried on in hoarse
whispers, was at this point interrupted by a movement
of the little boy. Johnson raised his hand and Winyard
crept forward, where he sat like a bronze statue, watching
the horizon.</p>

<p>It was about four o’clock, as the seamen guessed,
when the wind, which had been pretty steady from the
south-east, lulled, and then veering northward came on
to blow freshly. The men awakened Holdsworth, who
went to the helm. Mrs. Tennent, who had been aroused
by the withdrawal of the sailor’s shoulder, shivered with
the cold and crouched down to hug herself in her
clothes. Indeed, the north wind was cold enough; but
Holdsworth, observing the woman’s condition, whipped
off his coat without a word and buttoned it over her
shoulders, silencing her protests by kindly laughter and
encouraging words.</p>

<p>The change of wind produced a cross sea which
drenched the boat and made her movements horribly
uncomfortable. The wind increased, bringing up large
clouds, each of which was charged with a small rain-loaded
squall of its own. The sea rose, and matters
began to wear an ugly look. The men close-reefed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
sail, and Holdsworth finding that the boat shipped water
when on the wind, let her go free; and away they
scudded with a breeze growing in force every five
minutes astern of them. The utmost vigilance was now
needful in steering the boat. The waves were quick
and irritable, and broke in noisy surfaces of foam on
either gunwale, and from time to time it seemed inevitable
that their curling crests must arch themselves clean
into the boat and swamp her. Holdsworth parried
them with the rudder like a fencer with a foil. His
eye was marvellously quick, the movements of his hands
delicate and unerring. What the waves were to that
small open boat, the seas of the Pacific under a westerly
gale are to a full-rigged ship. She sank into hollows
half-mast deep, where the air was stagnant, behind and
before her black walls of illuminated water, the hinder
ones of which, catching her under the stern, raised her
with irresistible force to a height that turned her inmates
giddy and sick; and there, exposed to the wind,
her sail blew out to cracking limits and hurled her
madly forward&mdash;to sink into a new abysm, to experience
another interval of breathless, deadly calm.</p>

<p>“May God have mercy upon us!” exclaimed the
General, in one of these awful intervals, folding his arms
tightly and fixing his eyes on a towering sea rearing
astern of them like a hill.</p>

<p>But Holdsworth’s voice echoed cheerily: “She is a
brave boat, General; and it’s not my intention to let
such ripples as these” ... the rest of the sentence was
drowned in the hooting of the wind, as one of these
“ripples” swung the boat high in the full face of it, and
the “ripple” itself broke into an acre of foam under the
boat’s bows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The two sailors sat like logs, ready for the worst;
yet with a supreme confidence in Holdsworth’s skill as a
steersman, which he had already illustrated in a hundred
subtle ways, appreciable to none but them. St. Aubyn
lay in the bottom of the boat, motionless. The General,
holding on to the mast, was seated amidships, commending
his soul, and the souls of his comrades, to God, in
inaudible prayers. The widow crouched with her boy,
who still slept, in the stern-sheets; and beside her
towered the form of Holdsworth, a yoke-line in each
hand, his body inclined forward, his shirt-sleeves rolled
above his elbows, every nerve, every muscle in him
strung to the tension of steel, his glittering eyes fixed
upon the seas ahead, his whole attitude resembling a
sculptured personation of audacity, skill, and the finest
British courage.</p>

<p>The dawn broke and found them swinging over an
ugly sea, with the wind moderating. As the pallid light
spread over the bleak surface of gray and moving waters,
the weary shipwrecked men turned their eyes about in
search of a vessel; but the ocean was tenantless save by
its own leaping seas, which played around in an eternal
mockery of a fluctuating hilly horizon.</p>

<p>They were now sailing due south. Holdsworth
steered the boat, and Winyard baled her out; but,
thanks to the wonderful skill with which the rudder
was used, no single sea had been shipped, and what
water there was consisted of the spray that had been
blown into the boat off the crests of the waves when
she was in their hollows.</p>

<p>The sun rose and diffused an exquisite pink through
the ribbed clouds that barred the sky. His glorious
light flashed jewels upon the water, and sent a message<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of hope among the inmates of the tiny boat striving
amid the wild and throbbing wilderness of the deep.</p>

<p>The General stood up, and arching his hand over
his eyes, gazed slowly and intently around the whole
circumference of the water-line.</p>

<p>“We are alone,” he said; but instantly corrected
himself. “No, I speak thoughtlessly. We have God
with us. He has been with us all night. We thank
Thee, O God,” he murmured, folding his hands and
reverently lifting his face to the sky, “for Thy protection;
and we humbly implore Thee not to abandon us,
but to be with us in our anguish and desolation, and
in Thine own good time to snatch us from the perils
that encompass us.”</p>

<p>They all cried Amen!</p>

<p>“The wind’s lulling, master,” said Johnson to
Holdsworth. “We’ll have the sea smooth before
long.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Holdsworth!” exclaimed Mrs. Tennent,
starting up suddenly and hurriedly removing his coat
from her shoulders, “how cruelly selfish I have been to
deprive you of this covering throughout the long cold
night.”</p>

<p>“I’m better without it,” cried Holdsworth. “Even
my shirt-sleeves were too heavy for me&mdash;you see I have
had to turn them up. Winyard, rouse up Mr. St.
Aubyn. We shall be none the worse, any of us, for a
mouthful of biscuit.”</p>

<p>He patted the little boy with his left hand, with his
right kept the boat’s head straight as a line.</p>

<p>“Come, sir, wake up, please. Biscuit’s going to be
served out,” said Winyard, pulling the actor somewhat
unceremoniously by the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Both seamen thought him a white-livered gentleman,
and despised him accordingly.</p>

<p>The poor man lay athwart the boat, his legs doubled
up and his arms hiding his face. He shook his head,
without raising it, when Winyard pulled him, but did
not speak. The man, thinking him numbed or cramped,
raised him up; whereupon St. Aubyn struggled to his
feet, and looked about him with a fixed smile. That
smile made his face terrible to behold, for he was deadly
white, and a wild fire, with no more merriment in it
than a madman’s laugh, shone in his eyes, which looked
unnaturally large, and his lips were blue and thin, and
laid his teeth almost bare.</p>

<p>“You fellows may shrug your shoulders, and some
of you may hiss,” he muttered, never remitting his fixed
smile, but speaking through his teeth and bringing his
clenched fist upon his knee, “but you shan’t starve me,
because you don’t understand what true acting means.
Do you think I can’t tell what this hollowness, this sinking
is, here!” laying his hand upon his stomach and
sending his lustrous eyes travelling over the others, who
watched him in silence. “You are starving me, you
fiends, and driving a poor actor to death. But do you
think you will force him into the workhouse? No, by
God! He has spirit, and will seek a new home, a new
country, a new world, rather! Who tells me I cannot
act? Try me in farce, in comedy, in tragedy! See
now&mdash;shall I play you Tony Lumpkin?” He began
to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“‘Then, come, put the jorum about,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">And let us be merry and clever!</div>
      <div class="verse">Our hearts and our liquor are stout,</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Here’s the three Jolly Pigeons for ever.’</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<p>“Or shall I give you Lear?” He stretched out his
hands to the <span class="lock">sea:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">“‘Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!</div>
      <div class="verse">You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout</div>
      <div class="verse">Till you have drench’d our steeples, drown’d the cocks!</div>
      <div class="verse">You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,</div>
      <div class="verse">Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,</div>
      <div class="verse">Sings my white head!’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Is not that fine, gentlemen? Now turn about with
more shrugs, and drive me mad with your cant. Ha!
ha! ha!”</p>

<p>His laughter was shocking. The seamen shrank
away from him.</p>

<p>“He has gone mad with terror!” whispered the
General.</p>

<p>The widow hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>“Johnson,” said Holdsworth, “mix some rum and
water in that pannikin and give it to him with a biscuit.”</p>

<p>The actor took both, staring first at the pannikin,
then at the biscuit.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen!” he cried, with his wild smile, “I am
Timon of Athens, sour, crusty, and” ... he stopped
with a laugh. “But before his mind went, he pledged
his friends, standing thus:&mdash;‘Here’s to you&mdash;dogs!’”
He flung the contents of the pannikin at Holdsworth,
and dashed the vessel into the boat; “and with this, I
feed the winds!” and he hurled the biscuit into the
sea.</p>

<p>“Seize him!” shrieked Holdsworth, noticing a quick
movement on the actor’s part. The men sprang forward,
but too late to catch him. He leaped on to the thwart
and bounded overboard with a peal of laughter, ere you
could have cried “Hold!” and vanished under the crest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of a wave that was breaking at the moment under the
boat.</p>

<p>“See!” cried the General; “he has come to the surface!
There is his head! He may be saved yet!”</p>

<p>But the boat was foaming through the water at six
or seven knots an hour; the sea was still so lively that
to broach her to would have been to capsize her in an
instant.</p>

<p>“We cannot save him!” exclaimed Holdsworth,
bitterly, grasping the situation at once; and kept the
boat’s head doggedly away.</p>

<p>Those who watched the drowning man, saw him, a
mere dot, on the tumbling waters, heaved high on the
summit of a wave, with both his arms upraised; then
down he sank into the trough of the sea, the next wave
boiled over him, and they beheld him no more.</p>

<p>The General covered his face with his hands and
wept aloud. The widow was so sick and faint with the
horror of the scene, that she leaned back, white and
motionless, with her eyes closed. Johnson came aft
and put some rum to her lips, which revived her, and
then she began to weep silently, casting shuddering
backward glances at the sea, and hugging her boy to
her passionately. She had become, during the night,
the very ghost of her former self; her complexion was
ashen, her eyes hollow, her countenance gaunt with a
hard, weird look of old age upon it. Holdsworth
noticed that her dress was wet with salt water and
clung to her legs; but this it was impossible to remedy.
Infinite pity smote him as he gazed from her to her
child, and he handed her a biscuit, entreating her to eat
it. The boy ate his allowance quickly; but even out
of him something of the youthfulness and freshness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
his infancy had passed; a perception of their danger
and misery appeared to have visited him; and he clung
to his mother’s side, holding her dress with one hand
whilst he ate the biscuit, and gazing about him with
puzzled eyes, in which was mixed up a strong expression
of terror.</p>

<p>The impression produced by the sudden and tragical
death of the actor was more lasting on the widow and
the General than on the sailors, who were too sensible
of their own peril to find more than a passing occasion
of horror in the scene they had witnessed. They and
Holdsworth ate a biscuit apiece and drank their allowance
of water mixed with rum; but the General turned,
with an expression of loathing in his face, from the food,
and Mrs. Tennent could not be induced to eat more than
a few mouthfuls. Both drank of the water.</p>

<p>The waves were still lively enough to demand the
utmost care in the steering of the boat; but Winyard
had proved himself a smart steersman, and Holdsworth,
whose hands were cramped and blue with long grasping
of the yoke-lines, gladly surrendered his place to the
sailor.</p>

<p>“Strange,” muttered the General, “that we sight no
ships!”</p>

<p>“Our course is east,” said Holdsworth. “If the
wind would haul round a few points to the west, I’d
out reefs and bear up.”</p>

<p>The breeze held until twelve o’clock, when it slackened.
The sea having grown smoother during the
morning, Holdsworth hauled the sheet of the sail aft
and steered south-east by the compass, which was as
close to the sea as he deemed it advisable to sail the
boat. The sun now shone hot overhead, which greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
comforted Mrs. Tennent and revived the spirits of her
boy, who pulled a piece of string from his pocket, to
which he fastened a crooked pin, and began to fish.
As the afternoon advanced, the wind gradually died
away, and a thin haze settled upon the southern horizon,
portending both heat and calm. The water’s surface
turned to an aspect of polished steel; the boat rose and
sank to the swell, easily and with a soothing motion,
and the sail flapped idly against the mast.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, some porpoises came to the
surface of the water, about a stone’s throw from the
boat, rolling their gleaming black bodies in a southerly
direction.</p>

<p>“They always make for the quarter the wind’s
coming from,” said Winyard.</p>

<p>“I am afraid we shall have no wind to-night,”
answered Holdsworth; “the weather looks too settled.”</p>

<p>They watched the fish turning their solemn somersaults
until they were out of sight, and then, as though
to meet hope half-way, Holdsworth swarmed up the
boat’s mast and swept the horizon with piercing eyes,
but saw nothing but the boundless water-line paling
away against the sky.</p>

<p>The sun went down in glorious majesty, burnishing
the deep, and dazzling the eye with a splendour of
small radiant clouds, pierced with threads of glory, and
momentarily changing their brilliant hues until the orb
was under the sea, when they turned a bright red
colour. The twilight followed fast, the stars came out,
and the darkness of night fell upon the lonely deep.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE THIRD DAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>As no object could be served by keeping the sail hoisted,
they hauled it down and spread a portion of it over the
widow and her child. Holdsworth kept watch till ten,
and then awakened Winyard, who watched till twelve;
afterwards Johnson watched; and so the three men
took turn and turn about, all through the long and
breathless night, until daybreak, which found Winyard
awake in the stern-sheets, watching the pale dawn
breaking in the east.</p>

<p>Its approach at first was imperceptible. A faint gray
mingled in the prevailing darkness, and gradually grew
more defined; the stars languished, and those in the
extreme east hid themselves. Then a clearer light
broke stealthily about the eastern horizon; the sea
caught the glimmering dawn, and mirrored a pale and
sickly illumination, infinitely vague, as would be the
reflection in a looking-glass of a faint light. But soon
the lustre broadened, and streaks of horizontal silver
floated above the deep, and stood in layers of crystalline
clearness, awaiting a more ardent transformation. Then
a delicate pink flushed a wide space in the eastern sky,
which spread and spread until the farthermost heavens
shook off the heavy curtains of the night and melted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
into a pale and visionary blue. Anon, upon the eastern
water-line, stood a mere speck of white and exceedingly
brilliant light&mdash;a pure silver point of glory&mdash;which, as
the eye watched it, increased in size, flinging flake upon
flake of glittering icy splendour upon the water, until,
as with a sudden bound, it soared in sun-like shape and
flooded the heavens and the sea with strong rejoicing
light.</p>

<p>It awoke Holdsworth, who started up and stared
around him.</p>

<p>“Look, sir!” said Winyard, in a whisper that
sounded fierce with excitement, pointing towards the
south-east, where, upon the remote horizon, stood a
white speck clearly defined by the sunshine.</p>

<p>Holdsworth hollowed his hands tube-wise, gazed intently
for some moments, and then cried, “A sail!”</p>

<p>“Becalmed, master, as we are!” shouted Winyard;
whereat the sleepers in the boat stirred and opened their
eyes.</p>

<p>“Out oars, my men!” sang out Holdsworth. “A
sail, General! Do you see her? Look, Mrs. Tennent;
follow the direction of my finger! She is becalmed!
She cannot escape us! Hurrah, my lads!”</p>

<p>In less time than it takes me to write it, both seamen
were bending to the oars like madmen, making the
water break in clear lines of ripple against the boat’s
bows, which headed directly for the distant sail. Language
is powerless to describe the excitement of the
poor creatures. Mrs. Tennent shed tears; the General,
upon whose constitution, debilitated by old age, their
perilous situation and the mental sufferings which
accompanied it were beginning seriously to tell, stood
clutching the mast, his eyes riveted upon the white speck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and his attenuated face flushed with eagerness and hope.
The men, stretching to the long oars, looked from time
to time over their shoulders to remark the progress they
were making, and encouraged each other with cheerful
cries.</p>

<p>They had but two oars, and the boat was heavy and
moved reluctantly to the pressure of the blades; moreover,
the men were weakened by exposure and want of
nourishing food. Still they urged the boat through the
water at pretty nearly three miles an hour; and Holdsworth
repeatedly encouraged them by representing that
every stroke of the oars brought the boat nearer within
the range of the vision of those on board the vessel, and
increased the likelihood, under God’s providence, of
their rescue.</p>

<p>When the vessel was first sighted, she could not have
been less than ten miles distant; this was made manifest
by the circumstance of their continuing to row a
full hour before they had exposed her large sails, and
even then her hull was invisible. The ocean, meanwhile,
remained perfectly polished, without a shadow
anywhere upon its vast bosom to indicate the passage
of wind.</p>

<p>The seamen presently showing symptoms of distress,
Holdsworth took an oar, and bade Winyard, whom he
replaced, to drink some rum, and hand a draught to
Johnson. The General begged to take Johnson’s place
for a time while the man rested himself; but the poor
old gentleman, after rowing a few strokes, found himself
utterly unequal to the weight of the oar, and he returned
to his seat covered with perspiration, and breathing
with difficulty and pain.</p>

<p>It was seven o’clock by Holdsworth’s watch before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the hull of the vessel grew discernible; and then
Johnson, whose sight was very keen, pronounced her to
be a large three-masted brigantine. She had all her
sails set, but she was still so remote as scarcely to be
distinguished by an inexperienced eye from a cloud.</p>

<p>Winyard, who steered, asked Mrs. Tennent for her
black shawl, with which he climbed up the mast and
made it fast, flagwise. The motion of the boat hardly
created draught enough to unfurl it; but, drooping as
it did, it could scarcely fail to serve as a signal. The
calm which would have disheartened them under other
circumstances, as suspending all prospect of a rescue
whilst it lasted, was now deeply welcome to them as a
guarantee of their speedy release from the horrors of
their situation. As the vessel grew in dimensions under
the desperate exertions of the rowers, Mrs. Tennent became
hysterical, laughed and wept at the same moment,
and hugged her boy passionately to her. The old
General stood up waving his handkerchief, and talking
to himself, even wildly at times.</p>

<p>Holdsworth was now steering, and he bent eager
glances in search of some signal, some flag whose spot
of colour would surely be visible even at that distance,
to tell them they were seen.</p>

<p>Suddenly he cried out:</p>

<p>“Johnson&mdash;Winyard! Look! tell me what you can
see?”</p>

<p>The men rested on their oars simultaneously and
turned their heads towards the vessel. A silence ensued,
lasting some moments. Then Johnson exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There’s smoke coming out of her. Don’t you see
it, like a blue line between her fore and main masts?”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re boiling the pitch-kettle abaft the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
galley, as we used aboard the ‘Mary Ann,’” said Winyard,
wiping his forehead with his bare arm; “let’s
make for her, boys.”</p>

<p>And he fell to his oar again.</p>

<p>The water rippled round the boat’s sides once more,
and the shawl at the mast-head fluttered.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed; and then Holdsworth, whose
eyes never wandered from the vessel, saw something
black pass up her sails, rise over her masts and there
hang. Another followed; another yet; volumes now,
and each volume denser, blacker than its predecessor.</p>

<p>“She’s on fire!” he shouted; at which the men tilted
up their oars and stood up.</p>

<p>Quicker and quicker the black volumes, like balls
growing in size as they mounted, were vomited up, and
resembled an endless series of balloons rising from the
deck; they met when they reached a short height above
the masts, mingled and formed into a livid line which
gradually stretched north and south, but very slowly.
The spectators in the boat were paralysed; but their
emotions were too various and conflicting to permit the
deeper, deadlier ones of disappointment and despair to
make themselves felt as yet.</p>

<p>Holdsworth broke a long silence by exclaiming, “Can
you see them putting off?”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I see nothing. I reckon she’s abandoned
hours ago,” answered Winyard.</p>

<p>The General sank upon his knees with a groan,
clutching the gunwale and staring at the burning vessel
over his knuckles. There was no sign of a boat anywhere&mdash;no
sign of living creature being on board the
doomed craft. The smoke, which appeared to have
been pent up in the hold, had now escaped on a sudden;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and thick and thicker yet it mounted, marking an ugly
stain upon the pure morning sky, and hanging sombre
and menacing over the smouldering vessel like a thunder-cloud.
Soon a short tongue of flame protruded; then
came another and a longer one, which seemed to whiz
with a yellow radiance up the rigging and bury itself
in the smoke. Then the fire burst out in all directions;
in the time it would take you to count ten, the vessel
was a mass of flame, keen, brilliant, coiling, with streams
of thin blue smoke sailing out of each yellow ray, mingled
with particles of burning matter that winked among the
heavy cloud like fireflies in a dark evening. She was
four or five miles off; a mere toy on the surface of the
sea; and yet those who watched her from the boat could
distinctly hear the crackling of the fire, and the seething
of her flaming spars as they fell into the water. Anon
the fires flickered, and up drove new volumes of smoke,
which paled and thinned as the rekindled flames burst
forth again and darted their spear-shaped fangs into the
smoke-hidden sky.</p>

<p>For above an hour this terrible and magnificent
spectacle lasted, during which not a word escaped the
lips of the inmates of the boat. Their minds seemed
incapable of understanding the extinction of the hope
that had sustained them since sunrise, by a catastrophe
so unexpected, by a horror which united the extreme of
sublimity with the extreme of misfortune, and which
appeared scarcely more than a vision&mdash;so unforeseen, so
incredible, so illusive, so ghastly, so terrific was it.</p>

<p>By this time the whole of the upper masts were gone,
adding fuel to the interior furnace of the hull, and the
three lower masts were burning stumps. Suddenly the
blazing mass appeared to rise in the air; the fires went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
out as if by magic, and an opaque cloud, burnished a
livid blue by the sunshine, floated on the water. Not
for many moments after the flames had vanished came
a concussion that rent the air, loud and violent as a
thunder-clap among mountains. The cloud lifted, and
where the vessel had been the sea was a smooth outline,
reflecting only the dark shadow of the slowly-mounting
smoke, and dotted here and there with black
remnants of the wreck.</p>

<p>“Mr. Holdsworth,” said the General in a faint voice,
sinking backwards against a thwart, “I am dying.”</p>

<p>His hands were pressed to his heart; he was breathing
quickly and convulsively, and his face was bloodless.
His exclamation broke the spell that held the
others gazing in the direction of the smoke. They
turned quickly, and Holdsworth jumped over to the old
man and supported his head on his knee.</p>

<p>“No, no, General; don’t say that. This is a bitter
disappointment; but we believe in God’s goodness. He
cannot mean that we should perish. Johnson, pour
some rum into the pannikin. Mrs. Tennent, dip your
handkerchief into the sea and kindly pass it here.”</p>

<p>They put the spirit to the old man’s lip, and he
drank a little, but gasped for breath when he had swallowed
it and clenched his hands. They spread the wet
handkerchief over his forehead and loosened his cravat.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;&mdash;I know not what this giddiness may mean,”
the General stammered, while the lustre faded out of
his eyes. “If it is death ... I am ready to meet it.
God is merciful and good. His Son is my Redeemer
... He will take me to Himself ... how faint! how
faint! But I have eaten nothing”...</p>

<p>He ceased with a sudden gasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will feel better presently,” said Holdsworth,
while Mrs. Tennent took the old man’s hand and fanned
his face. “The shock of the burning ship has been too
great for you. But you will live to recall this time.
You have as manly a heart as ever God blessed His
creatures with. Don’t let it fail you now.”</p>

<p>“I have ... I have striven to do my duty,” murmured
the old man, so faintly that his words were
scarcely audible. “I have served my country ... she
is a great empire ... a great empire ... and my
heart is with old England, too;” forcing a smile, “we
should know each other better, sir, and our prejudices
would leave us, for .... for.... See! yonder is
Charleston!” he suddenly exclaimed, his eyes kindling,
and drawing his hand from Mrs. Tennent’s, to point
with it into the infinite horizon. “Do you see that
house on the left, there, with the green facing it? I
was born there, sir. Observe the barberry-bushes with
the red fruit on them&mdash;just there I fought my cousin,
when we were boys ... he’s a senator now, and they
tell me a good speaker. Oh, how the time goes!” he
sighed wearily. “But there’s my wife ... she is
holding the little one by the hand, and nodding to me
to attend her.... A moment, Sarah, a moment!
Gentlemen, farewell. I beg your kind word in my
favour among your countrymen, whom I honour. I am
a plain American gentleman&mdash;a general, gentlemen ...
but tell them that my sword was never drawn from
its scabbard for any cause but a good one, and ...
Ah, farewell! You see, gentlemen, my wife awaits me,
and the little one beckons.”</p>

<p>He made a gesture as though he would bow; his
venerable and honoured head sank upon his bosom;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
then he started, looked about him with a glazing eye,
and smiling sweetly, whispered, “Sarah, I am coming,”
lay back and spoke no more.</p>

<p>When, after long watching him, they knew that he
was dead, they covered him over with the sail, meaning to
commit him to the sea when the widow should be asleep.</p>

<p>Holdsworth was so greatly overcome that for many
minutes he could not raise his head nor speak. The
widow, with her eyes fixed on the water, sat motionless,
a fixed image of despair. Her boy crept about the
bottom of the boat at her feet, with somewhat weakly
movements, though his body had not yet suffered enough
to kill the infancy in his mind. The sailors, made selfish
by the bitter disappointment of the morning, talked
of their chances of rescue, and discussed the subject of
the burning ship. Johnson probably solved the mystery
of the deserted vessel when he suggested that during
the night the hands had found the cargo on fire&mdash;and
he judged by the blaze she made, and the smoke, and
the long time she was smouldering, that she was freighted
with cotton or coal&mdash;and had battened down the hatches;
but not having the means of getting the fire under, they
struck and took to the boats, obliging the skipper to go
along with them, and left the vessel to her fate. Just
such another case happened to a messmate of his in the
Bay of Biscay. The crew left their ship smouldering
under battened hatches. But <i>she</i> was boarded by a
Frenchman, who smothered the fire and towed her into
Bordeaux.</p>

<p>“Where was the brigantine’s crew, now?” Winyard
wondered.</p>

<p>“I wish we could fall in with them, if only for company’s
sake,” replied Johnson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>But of that there was very little chance.</p>

<p>All the afternoon the calm lasted, with light mists
hanging in wreaths upon the horizon. But about the
hour of sunset the smoke that had risen from the burning
ship, and which had not drifted more than a couple of
miles to the southward throughout the day, came sailing
slowly towards the boat and passed high overhead, thinning
its bulk as it travelled in an easterly direction. A
light breeze heralded it; they hoisted the sail, put the
boat’s head round, and stood east-south-east.</p>

<p>The night fell, but the light breeze held steady.
When they thought Mrs. Tennent was asleep, they
raised the body of the General in their arms from the
bottom of the boat. The night was lustrous with yellow
stars, which diffused sufficient light to enable them to
see the old man’s face. The eyes were closed, and,
though the under-jaw was fallen, there yet lingered an
expression both of firmness and sweetness about the
mouth. The draught under the sail moved his white hairs.</p>

<p>“Mates,” said Holdsworth in a whisper, “we pray
that God has taken this noble gentleman’s soul to Himself,
and that, though his body be dispersed in the sea,
it will rise again at the Day of Judgment, in the shape
we now behold it, to become a partaker of life everlasting,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.”</p>

<p>The two sailors answered Amen!</p>

<p>All three of them then tenderly handed the body,
over the boat’s side, and let it gently slip into the water.
The white hair glimmered for a brief moment on the
dark surface, and then the body sank or was swallowed
up in the gloom; and the boat rippled onwards, cutting
the star flakes in the sea with her stem, and leaving
them glittering in silver fragments in her wake.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />

<span class="smaller">THE FOURTH DAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A fourth day broke, and found the boat almost becalmed
again. The intense tedium of their captivity
cannot be expressed by words. The eternal iteration
of the water-line became a torment and a pang, and
forced them to look into the boat or upon one another
for relief of the strained and weary eye. Their limbs
were cramped for want of space to stretch themselves.
Holdsworth’s cheeks were sunk, and the hollows of his
eyes dark; and a black beard and moustache, sprouting
upon his chin and lip, gave him a gaunt and grizly look.
The men sat with rounded backs and hopeless eyes,
fixed downwards, and sinewy hands clasped upon their
knees.</p>

<p>But the effect of the sufferings, bodily and mental,
they were enduring, was most visible in the widow,
whose face was scarcely recognisable for the wasted,
aged, pallid, and heart-broken aspect that it presented.</p>

<p>When the little boy awoke he began to cry and complain
of pains in his limbs and back. His mother
seemed too weak to support or even soothe him with
speech. Holdsworth took him upon his knee and talked
to him cheerfully, that he might inspirit the others as
well as himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Louis, you are a little man; you must not cry,
because it grieves your poor mamma, who cannot bear
to see your tears. Your back aches because your bed
has been a hard one; but you won’t have that uncomfortable
bed long. Don’t you remember what the poor old
General said: that God, whose eye is everywhere, sees
us, and will pity us, and send a ship to our rescue if
we will but have patience, and not murmur against
Him. Many vessels have been wrecked as well as the
‘Meteor,’ and their crews taken to the boats, and rescued
by passing ships, after they had suffered more anguish
and misery than we can dream of. The fortune that
befell them may befall us. We must put our whole
trust in God, and watch the horizon narrowly. This is
but our fourth day, and the very breeze that is now
blowing may be gradually bearing us towards a ship.
So no more tears, my man. Here is a biscuit for you.
Give this one to your mamma. Here, Johnson&mdash;Winyard.”</p>

<p>He handed the men a biscuit apiece, and bade
Johnson serve out the water.</p>

<p>There were three kegs in the boat, as stated elsewhere.
They had calculated that by allowing each
person half a pannikin of water a day, their stock would
last them ten days. But now there were two mouths
less, and they might hope to make the water serve them
for as long as thirteen days. It would seem, however,
that, in spite of the injunctions of Captain Steel, the
boats had been provisioned hurriedly. Of biscuit,
Holdsworth had an abundance; but nothing but negligence
or haste could account for the absence of other
provisions, such as rice, flour, beef and pork, dried peas,
and such fare; unless, indeed, it was considered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
none of these things would be eatable unless cooked.
Though Holdsworth’s boat might not have fared the
worst, it was manifest that the quantity of water that
had been put into her was out of proportion with the
biscuit that filled the locker. They had used the water
in one of the larger kegs first, and Johnson, in measuring
out the allowance, found that scarcely enough remained
to fill the pannikin by a quarter. Holdsworth told him
to pull the bung out of one of the other kegs, and when
the little boy, who was first served, had emptied the
pannikin, the next draught was handed to the widow.
She raised it to her lips eagerly, her mouth being
feverish; but had scarcely sipped it, when she put it
down, exclaiming that the water was salt.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” cried Holdsworth quickly, and tasted
the water.</p>

<p>The widow was right. The water was not indeed
salt, but so brackish as to be quite unfit to drink.</p>

<p>He spat it out at once, his instincts cautioning him
that he would increase his thirst by swallowing it, and
looked blankly at the men.</p>

<p>“What! <i>is</i> it salt?” exclaimed Winyard furiously.</p>

<p>“Try the other keg,” said Holdsworth, throwing the
contents of the pannikin away.</p>

<p>Johnson drew some of the water and tasted it, but
also spat it out, as Holdsworth had done.</p>

<p>“Is that salt too?” shrieked Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“Try it!” answered Johnson grimly, coming aft with
the pannikin.</p>

<p>That, too, like the other, was brackish and unfit to
be drunk.</p>

<p>“Great God!” exclaimed Holdsworth, clasping his
hands convulsively; “how could this have happened?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was the steward as filled these kegs,” said
Winyard. “I saw him myself pumping out o’ the starboard
water cask, which the sea was washing over when
the masts went, and draining the salt water in.” He
added fiercely, “I’ll lay he took care to fill the kegs of
the boat he belonged to with the right kind!”</p>

<p>“Hand that pannikin here,” said Holdsworth; and
mixed some rum with the water and tasted it, but the
dose was indescribably nauseous.</p>

<p>This discovery was a frightful blow; so overwhelming
that it took their minds some minutes to realise it
in its full extent.</p>

<p>They were now absolutely without a drop of fresh
water in the boat; which fact was made the more
terrible by the consideration that, up to the moment of
discovery, they had believed themselves stocked with
sufficient water to last them for another week at the
very least.</p>

<p>They were appalled and subdued to images of stone
by this last and worst addition to the series of heavy
misfortunes that had befallen them.</p>

<p>Then Winyard, who was already tormented with
thirst, for they had permitted themselves to drink no
water during the night, began to blaspheme, rolling his
eyes wildly and calling curses on the head of the
steward for his murderous negligence. He terrified the
boy into a passion of tears, which increased his fury, and
he stood up and menaced the child with his outstretched
fist.</p>

<p>“Sit down!” exclaimed Holdsworth, in a voice that
fell like a blow upon the ear. “You are going mad
some days too soon, you lubber! Do you hear me?
Sit down!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The man scowled at him, and then threw himself
backwards into the bows of the boat.</p>

<p>“Will your shrieks and oaths give us water?”
Holdsworth continued bitterly. “You are not more
thirsty than I, nor this poor lady, from whom you have
not heard one syllable of complaint since she was handed
into the boat!”</p>

<p>He turned to her with a look of deep compassion.</p>

<p>“Try to sustain your courage under this awful trial,”
he exclaimed. “Our position is not yet hopeless.
There is no sea more largely navigated than the Atlantic,
by vessels bound to all parts of the world, and I say it
is almost inevitable that we should fall in with a ship
soon.”</p>

<p>She forced a wan smile for answer, but did not
speak; merely put her hand on her child’s shoulder and
drew him to her.</p>

<p>As the morning advanced the heat of the sun increased,
and the rays seemed to absorb the light breeze
out of the atmosphere; the sea turned glassy, and by
noon the boat was becalmed. Meanwhile, Winyard remained
doggedly buried in the bows of the boat, sucking
his dry lips, with despair legibly written upon his countenance.
Johnson appeared to find relief by plunging
his arm in the water and moistening his head and face.
The very boat took a white, baked, thirsty aspect; and
the heat made the paint upon her exhale in a faint and
sickly smell.</p>

<p>When the afternoon was waning, Winyard got up
and crept stealthily to the after-part of the boat.
Holdsworth kept his eyes steadily upon him. His intention,
however, was no more than to take up the pannikin,
which he snatched at hastily, as though fearing that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
purpose would be frustrated. He then hastened forward
and filled the vessel from one of the kegs.</p>

<p>“Don’t drink it!” exclaimed Holdsworth; “it will
increase your thirst.”</p>

<p>But the man, pointing to his throat, swallowed the
briny draught hastily, then put the pannikin down with
a sigh of relief and with a face cleared of something of
its peculiar expression of pain.</p>

<p>Johnson seized the pannikin, meaning to follow
Winyard’s example. Holdsworth entreated him to
desist. “The salt will madden you!” he exclaimed.
He had scarcely said this, when Winyard began to roll
his body about, uttering short, sharp cries.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards he vomited, his face turned
slate colour, and they thought he would expire. Holdsworth
drained some rum into his mouth, and poured
sea-water from the pannikin in long streams over his
head. This somewhat revived him; but he lay groaning
and cursing, and clutching at the sides of the boat
with his finger-nails for many minutes.</p>

<p>His sufferings frightened Johnson, who called out:</p>

<p>“Master, if the water in the kegs is poison, we
should let it run away.”</p>

<p>“It is worse than poison,” replied Holdsworth. “Pull
out the bungs&mdash;the sea-water around us is as wholesome
to drink as that stuff.”</p>

<p>Johnson then turned the kegs over and let them
drain themselves empty.</p>

<p>After this a silence fell upon the boat which lasted a
full hour, when the boy said:</p>

<p>“Mamma, I am thirsty. Give me something to
drink.”</p>

<p>It was shocking to hear the child’s complaint, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
feel the <i>impossibility</i> of satisfying him. The mother
started up with a wild gesture, and cried in a fierce
whisper, that was thickened in its passage through her
swollen throat:</p>

<p>“O my God! let us both die! End our misery now.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth watched her mutely.</p>

<p>Her appeal died away, and she sank back, exhausted
by the sudden outbreak.</p>

<p>The sun went down and some clouds came up behind
the horizon to receive the glowing disc. These spread
themselves slowly over the heavens, albeit the sea
remained breathlessly calm; and thinking that the wind
was coming up that way, the poor sufferers turned their
eyes wildly and eagerly towards the west, hoping with
a desolate hope for the vessel that was to rescue them,
but which no day brought.</p>

<p>When the night fell, Winyard began to sing in a
strange husky voice; but his tones soon died out, and
then came the small weak cry of, “Mamma, I am thirsty!
give me some water!” from the little boy, wounding the
ear with an edge of agony in the stillness and the gloom.</p>

<p>Presently a soft sigh of wind came from the west,
which backed the sail. Holdsworth put the boat’s head
round until the sail filled, and then hauled the sheet aft,
meaning to lay close to the wind, that they might sooner
encounter the ship that the wind was to bring. The
air sank into a calm again; but another puff followed
which made the water gurgle, and it was plain that a
breeze was coming, by the clouds which were drifting
eastwards. The wind freshened and then became steady,
and the boat, bending to the weight of the full sail,
stirred the water into fire, which flashed and vanished
in her wake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>It mattered little which way Holdsworth steered the
boat; but let him head her as he would, there was
always the haunting sense upon him that he was speeding
away from the ship that would rescue them; that
by pointing yonder, or yonder, or yonder, a vessel would
be encountered. The breeze and the movement of the
boat revived Winyard, who lolled over on the lee side,
finding relief in letting his hands trail through the water.
The boy had ceased his complaints, and lay sleeping
along the thwart, with his head on his mother’s knee.
Johnson also slept.</p>

<p>The thirst that had tormented Holdsworth during
the afternoon had now in some measure abated. There
were four or five bottles of rum still left in the stern
locker, and, hoping to hit upon some means to deal with
the sufferings with which they were threatened by the
absence of water, he soaked a piece of biscuit in the
spirit and tasted it. But he at once perceived that no
relief was to be obtained by this expedient, but that, on
the contrary, the spirit would irritate the throat and increase
the dryness. He threw the piece of biscuit away,
and began to think over all the stories he had ever
heard of men who had suffered from thirst in boats at
sea, that he might recollect any one way they adopted
for diminishing their torments. He had been shipmates
with a man, in one of his earlier voyages, who, together
with three other men, had been miraculously rescued by
a vessel, after they had been at sea in an open boat
exactly twenty-one days, during which they had drifted
above seven hundred miles from the spot at which their
ship had gone down. Holdsworth could only remember
two of the expedients they resorted to when maddened
with hunger and thirst: one was, tearing off pieces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
their shirts and chewing them; the other, cutting
wounds in their arms and sucking the blood. This last
was a remedy from which he recoiled with horror; nor
were his sufferings so great just then as to tempt him to
try the other.</p>

<p>“Master!” called out Winyard, in a husky voice,
“what longitude do you reckon we’re in?”</p>

<p>“We were in twenty-eight west when the ship went
down, and I doubt if we are many miles distant from
the same place.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t there no chance of our sighting a ship,
master?”</p>

<p>“Yes, every chance.”</p>

<p>“I reckon the skipper has run the long-boat into the
regular tracks by this time,” grumbled the man; “it’s
cursed hard upon us that we should be left to die here
like dogs.”</p>

<p>To this Holdsworth made no answer, and Winyard,
after muttering awhile to himself, began to splash the
water in his face by scooping it out with his hand.
Then Johnson, in his sleep, called out for something to
drink, on which Winyard, with an oath, answered, “Ay,
you may call out! If calling ’ud bring it, I’d make
noise enough, I’ll lay!”</p>

<p>The clouds overhead, though widely sundered one
from another, were heavy, and Holdsworth constantly
directed his weary eyes at them, praying for a shower
of rain. At midnight, or thereabouts, Johnson was
awakened, and came aft to relieve Holdsworth at the
helm. The two men whispered together about Winyard,
saying that he was not to be trusted with the management
of the boat whilst the breeze held; and it was
agreed that Holdsworth should replace Johnson at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
expiration of two hours, by the watch, which Johnson
took and put in his pocket. But before lying down,
Holdsworth dipped the sail and put the boat around.
Her head on the port tack was north-west and by
north.</p>

<p>“Keep a sharp look-out to windward, Johnson, and
call me at once if you sight anything,” said Holdsworth;
then packed himself against the mast and fell into a
doze.</p>

<p>When he was asleep, Winyard came out of the bows,
and stepped to the stern-sheets and began to talk to
Johnson. After awhile, he said he should like to see
what quantity of biscuit they still had, and lifted the
seat over the locker. Johnson, who suspected nothing,
had his eyes fixed on the weather horizon; and Winyard,
snatching at a bottle of rum, thrust it cunningly
into his bosom, and hurried forward.</p>

<p>All this time the boy was sleeping; but it was impossible
to tell whether his mother slumbered or not.
She never once stirred. She sat on the weather side,
close against Johnson. Her child’s head was upon her
knee, and her hands were clasped upon his shoulder.
She kept her face bowed, her chin upon her breast.</p>

<p>At two o’clock by the watch, Johnson called Holdsworth,
who instantly sat upright, and before rising, bent
his head under the foot of the sail to take a look to
leeward. He had scarcely done this when he uttered a
cry, and then fell dumb, pointing like a madman.
Johnson leaned sideways, and saw the outline of a large
ship, about a mile distant, running with the wind free
on her starboard quarter.</p>

<p>“Put your helm up! Head for her!” gasped
Holdsworth, springing aft; and then as the boat swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
round, he jumped on to a thwart, and hollowing his
hands, shouted, but his shout was feeble and hoarse;
the constricted throat dulled and choked his voice.
Johnson also shouted, but his voice was even weaker
than Holdsworth’s.</p>

<p>“They will not leave us! they will not leave us!”
shrieked Mrs. Tennent, rising suddenly and extending
her hands towards the ship, which the movement of the
boat’s rudder had brought on the starboard beam.</p>

<p>As she cried, Winyard stood up in the boat’s bows,
reeling wildly, and mad with the drink he had abstracted.
His gestures and fury were horrible to witness. His
husky screeches sounded as the voice of one suffering
indescribable torment. He brandished his arms towards
the ship, which was drawing ahead rapidly, and in his
drunken excitement leaped upon the gunwale of the
boat, where he stood balancing himself, and tossing his
clenched fists above his head. Just then the boat dipped
and sank into the hollow of a swell; the drunken madman
made a grab at the leach of the sail to steady himself&mdash;missed
it&mdash;and went head backwards overboard.</p>

<p>Holdsworth bounded aft to catch him as he floated
past; but he remained under water until the boat was
some yards ahead; and then they could hear his bubbling
cries and the splashing of his arms.</p>

<p>Holdsworth’s first instinct was to bring the boat
round; but Johnson divined his intention, and twirling
the yoke-lines furiously around his hands, cried:</p>

<p>“No! no! we can’t save him! he’ll have sunk before
we can reach him! Let’s follow the ship&mdash;she may
see us!” And he bawled “Ahoy! ahoy!” but his
hoarse voice fainted in his throat.</p>

<p>Holdsworth grasped one of the yoke-lines, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
was a short struggle. The boat’s head yawed wildly.
But by this time nothing was to be heard astern but the
wash of the water as the boat sucked it into eddies.</p>

<p>Holdsworth let go the yoke-line, sprang forward and
dipped the sail clear of the mast; crying that there
were four lives to be saved, and it would be as bad as
murder to stop the boat now.</p>

<p>The ship was distinctly visible on the port bow, every
sail on her standing in a clean black outline against the
sky. She showed no lights, and further than that she
was a full-rigged ship, it was impossible to tell what she
resembled. They watched her with wild despair, utterly
powerless to attract her attention, and dependent upon
the faint possibility of their glimmering sail being distinguishable
on the black surface of the water. If the
wind would only lull now, if such a calm as that which
had held them motionless the day before would fall,
their rescue was inevitable. But the light breeze
remained steady, and the ship ahead slipped forward
nimbly, and became soon a square shadow against the
winking stars over the horizon.</p>

<p>How horrible to be abandoned for lack of means to
make their presence known! Any kind of light would
have served them.</p>

<p>The widow moaned and beat her breast as the vessel
faded into the darkness; Johnson flung himself doggedly
down, and sat resting his elbow on his knee, gnawing his
finger-nails; whilst Holdsworth stood upright forward,
gazing with wild, passionate, intense despair, in the
direction of the ship long after she had vanished.</p>

<p>There could be little doubt that, had Johnson kept a
proper look-out, he would have seen the ship in time to
put his helm up, and run within easy hail of her. Holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>worth
knew this, but would not increase the misery of
their situation by useless reproaches.</p>

<p>The child, who had been awakened by their cries,
now that silence had fallen began to ask eagerly and
importunately for water, and even reproached his mother
for not attending to him.</p>

<p>“I am hot&mdash;hot!” he petitioned. “Mamma, give
me water.”</p>

<p>Once during his appeals she started up and glared
about her, as if there <i>must</i> be some means of relieving
his sufferings; and then crying, “I shall go mad!” fell
back with a low, heart-broken sob, and spoke no more,
though the child persisted in his entreaties for a long
while. Finally he burst into tears, and after plucking
at his throat for a time, sank into an uneasy slumber,
in which he uttered low moaning cries repeatedly.</p>

<p>A stupor now fell upon Holdsworth&mdash;a species of
drowsy indifference to his fate and to the fate of his
companions. He had fallen wearily upon a thwart and
sat with his back against the mast, and visions began
to float before him, and his whole physical being seemed
lapped into a dreamy insensibility, that subdued, whilst
it lasted, that subtle agonising craving for water which,
since he was awakened from his sleep, had tormented
him with a pang more exquisite than any other form of
human suffering. He fought with the dangerous listlessness
for some time, terrified at without understanding
its import; but in spite of him, his mind wandered,
and he presently thought that Dolly was at his side;
whereupon he addressed her, and seemed to receive her
answers, and asked her questions in a low, strange voice,
often smiling as though the light of her eyes were upon
his face and his arm around her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>His language was audible and intelligible; but
Johnson, with one of the yoke-lines over his knees, his
head supported in his hands, paid no more heed to him
than to the flapping of the sail as the boat sometimes
broached to; which insensibility was as shocking as the
other’s delirious chattering.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />

<span class="smaller">THE FIFTH DAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In this way the boat drifted on until the dawn broke,
when the wind fell.</p>

<p>Johnson lifted his head and looked about him; and
first for the ship that had passed them in the night&mdash;but
she was nowhere visible; then at Holdsworth, whose
delirium had yielded to sleep, and who slumbered with
his feet on the thwart, his back arched like a bow, and
his head between his knees; then at the widow, who
drooped against the boat’s side, her arm over the gunwale,
and her hand in the water.</p>

<p>The boy was wide awake, reclining in the bottom of
the boat, with his head against his mother’s dress. His
eyes looked large and glassy, his lips white, and his skin
dusky-hued. When he met Johnson’s gaze, he smiled
as though he would coax him to give him what he
wanted, and tried to speak, but his lips rather formed
than delivered the word “water.” The man stared at
him with the insensibility of despair in his eyes: and
the boy, thinking that he had not heard him, and that
he would get what he desired, if he could but articulate
his wish, tried to stand up, meaning to draw close to
the man’s ear; but his legs sank under him, and so he
remained at the bottom of the boat smiling wanly and
pointing to his throat, as though such dumb-show must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
needs soften Johnson’s heart, and obtain some water
for him.</p>

<p>Holdsworth awoke with a start and tried to speak;
but the roof of his mouth was dry, and his tongue felt
rusty like a cat’s; moreover, his throat burned, and the
sounds he uttered scathed and lacerated him.</p>

<p>The boy, seeing him awake, turned to him as a friend
who would relieve him: and moaned his distress. The
spectacle of his agony, and his own sufferings, maddened
Holdsworth. All along he had dreaded the temptation
of the rum, the fiery quality of which, whilst it momentarily
allayed, would, he was sure, aggravate tenfold the
craving for water. But suffering mastered him now.
He seized the pannikin and pouring out some of the
liquor, put it to the boy’s dry lips. He drank greedily,
but the ardent spirit checked his breath, and he struggled
wildly, beating the air with his little hands.</p>

<p>But meanwhile Holdsworth had also drunk, and
handed the remainder of the draught to Johnson, his
throat softened, and his tongue capable now of articulation.
Johnson drew a deep breath, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Thank God for that, master. I should have taken
it before had I thought it good for me.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth gave the boy a biscuit, which he grabbed
at, and thrust large pieces into his mouth, as though
seeking to extinguish the fire that the rum had kindled.</p>

<p>When the pain of the burning spirit had passed, he
said, “Give mamma some. When you were asleep, Mr.
Holdsworth, I heard her calling for water.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth, thinking that she slept, would not
arouse her; but noticing that her arm hung awkwardly
over the boat’s side, and left the half-closed fingers
trailing in the water, he raised it gently to place her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
hand on her lap. In doing this, he observed a lifelessness
in her arm such as sleep could not induce. He
peered into her face, and cried out quickly:</p>

<p>“O my God!”</p>

<p>Then bade Johnson move, that he might get beside
her, and reverently lifted her head.</p>

<p>There was no need to glance twice at her face to
know what had happened, although the heart-broken
expression in it would almost suggest that she slept,
and was dreaming a painful dream. Her eyes were
half-closed, her under-jaw had dropped, yet she looked
even in her death a sweet, long-suffering woman.</p>

<p>“Give her something to drink,” pleaded the little
boy, passionately, imagining from her silence, and the
expression on her face, that she was suffering as he had
and could not speak.</p>

<p>“She don’t want it&mdash;she’s dead!” answered Johnson.</p>

<p>Holdsworth half turned, but checked the exclamation
that rose to his lips, feeling that the bitter truth must
be made known to the child sooner or later.</p>

<p>The boy did not understand the answer; he crawled
upon his mother’s knee, with the pannikin in his hand,
which he held out whilst he said: “Wake up, mamma!
Open your eyes! Mr. Holdsworth will give you something
to drink.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth removed the child, and seated him near
the mast, and bade him stop there. He then returned,
and lifting the poor woman from her seat, placed her
gently in the bottom of the boat, throwing her dress
over her face to hide the anguish in it, and blot out the
mockery of the daylight.</p>

<p>The boy began to cry, and asked Mr. Holdsworth to
wake his mamma up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither of the men could answer him.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, the wind veered round to the north,
and came on to blow in quick, fretful puffs. The sky
grew cloudy, and indications were not wanting of the
approach of a gale. Holdsworth took the helm, whilst
Johnson lowered the sail and close-reefed it, and the
quick jump of the sea, coupled with the small space of
sail shown, making it impossible for them to head for
the east, without driving bodily to leeward, they slackened
out the sheet and let the boat run, keeping the
wind about two points on her port quarter.</p>

<p>A squall of rain came up and wetted them. They
turned their mouths in the direction whence it came,
and gaped to receive the delicious drops; but it blew
against their faces and slantwise along the sea, and was
soon over. It left a little pool on one of the thwarts,
and Holdsworth told the boy to put his lips to it. He
did so, and lapped the moisture like a dog; whilst
Holdsworth and Johnson removed the handkerchiefs
from their necks which the rain had damped, and sucked
them.</p>

<p>The wind increased, the sea became heavy, and the
heavens overcast with a vast extent of lead-coloured
cloud that stretched from horizon to horizon. At noon,
when the boat was on the summit of a wave, Johnson
caught sight of a vessel on their lee quarter. The boat
plunged downwards, and the vessel was lost to view;
but, on mounting again, they beheld the vessel, under
double-reefed top-sails, standing westwards right across
their stern. She was not above a mile and a half away,
but she might as well have been a thousand, for the boat
could no more have made for her in that sea than she
could have sailed in the wind’s eye. There was a faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
chance that the people on board of her might catch sight
of the shawl that streamed like a black flag from the
mast-head; and, each time the boat sank into a hollow,
the poor men waited with wild and dreadful eagerness
for her to rise, that they might observe whether the
vessel had seen and was following them. But she
did not alter her course, and in ten minutes’ time
vanished in the haze.</p>

<p>Neither of the men spoke: Johnson, by the expression
on his face, appeared to have resigned himself to
despair, and all Holdsworth’s thoughts were concentrated
in keeping the boat clear of the seas which boiled around
her. He was very weak; so much so that there were
moments when, a sea catching the boat under the stern,
he had scarcely the power to keep the yoke square and
prevent the rudder from being jammed athwart-ships
upon its pintles by the pressure of the water; which,
had it happened, would have swept the boat broadside
on and filled her.</p>

<p>Added to this, the torment of thirst was again upon
him. He kept the end of his handkerchief in his mouth,
literally chewing it to pulp, and constantly directing
thirsty glances at the clouds, and praying for another
shower of rain.</p>

<p>His own suffering made him perceive that the rum
would be a curse to them whilst it lasted, inducing them
to drink it, and presently maddening them with fresh
accesses of thirst. The boy was suffering again, and
was crawling upon his hands and knees over the thwarts
in search of some rain moisture; and presently Holdsworth
saw him put his tongue against the mast and
lick it. Johnson hung, with an air of despairful recklessness,
over the boat’s side, dashing the water in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
face, and letting the foam fly up his arm and soak his
breast.</p>

<p>The boat presently made a plunge downwards&mdash;a
long, wild, sweeping fall; the roaring of the waves
sounded overhead; the sail flapped, and there was a
pause of breathless calm that lasted some moments.</p>

<p>Holdsworth looked behind him and shrieked out:
“Seize the boy, and throw yourself down!”</p>

<p>The man extended his hands, and, grappling the
child, rolled backwards, under a thwart.</p>

<p>It came&mdash;a huge, green, unbroken sea, arching its
emerald top on a level with the yard of the sail, and
following the boat with a spring like a tiger’s. Holdsworth
stretched himself out, his feet hard against the
aftermost thwart, his back squared, his elbows out, his
hands grasping the yoke-lines with a death grip.</p>

<p>Up went the boat&mdash;stem up&mdash;yet up! as though
she must be flung clean over on end; then came the
rush and roar of water&mdash;it fell with a weight of lead on
Holdsworth’s back, and beat, with a ponderous single
blow, the breath out of him, but could not root him
from his seat; it broke into a vast surface of foam,
divided, and swept forward, hissing, spluttering, bubbling,
raging; met at an angle at the boat’s bows and half
filled her! Down she swooped into another hollow, and
half the water ran out over her bows, the remainder,
as she rose, came rushing aft and filled the stern-sheets;
and up and down, up and down, it washed.</p>

<p>But the boat still lived, and Holdsworth was her
master.</p>

<p>“Bear a hand aft here and bale her out!” he shouted.</p>

<p>Johnson let go the half-drowned child, and struggled
over the thwarts, blowing and shaking his soaked hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
like rope-yarns off his face, his clothes streaming with
water; flopped down, found the cocoa-nut shell, and
baled with fury.</p>

<p>The child crouched in the bows, too terrified to cry.</p>

<p>The boat flashed along, skimming the frothing heads
of the waves; she had outlived an exceptionally heavy
sea, and seemed to feel her triumph as she flew.</p>

<p>But, oh! the ghastly burden that she bore! the dead
and dripping woman, off whose face the water had
washed the covering, and left it naked to the daylight;
the gaunt bearded spectre baling out the boat on his
knees, his wet clothes clinging to his frame like a skin
of silk, and disclosing the piteous attenuation of the
body; the steersman with wild and lustrous eyes sunk
deep in livid sockets, the yoke-lines writhed around his
lean brown hands, his lips pale and cracked, and his
long neglected hair hanging like a wet mat over his
forehead and down his back; and the shivering little
figure in the bows, his hands squeezed together in an
attitude of prayer, and his small face glimmering with
unearthly ghastliness upon the gray background of the
boat’s interior.</p>

<p>Some flying-fish leaped out of the sea close to the
boat, and buried their silver arrow-like shapes in a wave
some distance ahead. Then the sun broke through a
rent in the broad sombre cloud, and made the pelting
ocean joyous with a snatch of cheerful light. But the
strong wind lasted all the afternoon, and when it lulled
just before sunset, Holdsworth was so exhausted, that
in rising to give his seat to Johnson, he reeled and sank
in a heap close beside the corpse at the bottom of the
boat, and lay motionless and insensible. Johnson
made no effort to restore him. Indeed, he thought he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
was dead. His own brain whirled; his tongue seemed
to fill his mouth; there crept over him such a stupor
as had visited Holdsworth; he let the yoke-lines go,
and fixing his eyes on the sea, prepared to meet the
death which his sensations led him to believe was at
hand.</p>

<p>The boat, tossed like a cork on the troubled water,
broached to; but happily the wind was momentarily
dying away; her head came round to the seas and she
rode with as much safety as if Holdsworth were at the
helm.</p>

<p>For a whole hour the interior of the boat presented
the same scene; the men motionless as the dead body,
the boy squatting in the bows with nothing seemingly
alive about him but his eyes, which winked as he rolled
them seawards, where the sun shone on the water.
Then Holdsworth began to groan and stir; whereupon
Johnson fixed his dull eyes upon him, and watched him
without any curiosity, without any sympathy, without
any interest&mdash;indeed, scarcely, I might say, with human
intelligence.</p>

<p>The boy, seeing Holdsworth move, came creeping aft
and remained on his knees, first looking at the man
awaking to consciousness, and then at his mother, whose
motionlessness and drowned aspect, and face made unfamiliar
to him by its total want of expression, terrified
him.</p>

<p>Holdsworth raised his head and looked about him in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Where have I been? What has happened?” he
cried.</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes on the dead woman, his glance reverted
to the boy, and then consciousness fully awoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
He rose wearily to his feet, and sank with a heavy sigh
near Johnson, at whom he looked, scarcely knowing
whether the man slept or was dead.</p>

<p>The boy begged for water.</p>

<p>“Water!” exclaimed Holdsworth in a choking voice;
“there is none.”</p>

<p>But there was biscuit, and he turned to the locker
to give him one, thinking that the food might relieve
the child’s thirst. He stretched out his arm to lift the
seat of the locker and found the locker filled with salt
water. With a cry of despair he dragged out a bag
streaming with wet, and thrusting his hand into it
found its contents soaked into pulp. The other bag
was in the same condition; and to make matters worse,
of the three bottles of rum that had been in the locker,
one only was left; the other two were cracked and
empty.</p>

<p>It was easy to understand how this had happened.
A sea breaking over the boat’s stern could not have
filled the locker; the water which the boat had shipped
over her bows had come rushing aft when the boat
mounted the next wave, and filling the stern-sheets,
raised the seat that formed the lid of the locker, and
poured over the biscuit, at the same time forcing the
bottles against each other and breaking them.</p>

<p>“Do you see what has happened?” exclaimed Holdsworth,
grasping Johnson’s arm. The man looked over
his shoulder, shook his head, and muttered, “We’re
doomed to die. There’s no hope, master.”</p>

<p>What was to be done? Holdsworth thought that
if the biscuits could be dried in the sun they might be
fit to eat, and endeavoured to spread some of them
along the thwart; but the stuff squeezed up in his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
like thick paste. He tasted a little and found it no
better than salt, and he flung the bag down with a
groan that seemed to express the extinction of his last
faint hope.</p>

<p>But there was a bottle of rum left. He prised out
the cork with the blade of his knife, and gave a spoonful
to the boy diluted with two or three drops of sea water.
He then set the pannikin to Johnson’s lips, who sucked
the hard metal rim as a baby might. Finally moistening
his own throat with a small quantity of the liquor,
he carefully corked the bottle and stowed it away.</p>

<p>No! To say that hope had entirely abandoned him
would not be true. Whilst the heart continues to
pulsate hope will still be found to live, however faintly,
in its throbs, though each moment be heavy with pain,
and nothing seem sure but anguish and death.</p>

<p>The wind had died away, but the boat rose and sank
to the long and heavy swell that billowed the gleaming
surface of the sea to the horizon. Far away in the
south was an expanse of gray cloud with slanting lines
radiating to the sea from it, and a bright square of rainbow
embedded in its shadow. It was travelling eastwards,
and the rain would not touch the boat. Elsewhere
the sky was a bright blue, with here and there
clouds of glorious whiteness and majestic bulk&mdash;mountains
with shining defiles and a splendour of sunshine
in their skirts&mdash;hanging their swelling forms over the
sea. The sun was hot, but then, ever since they had
been in the boat, they had been steering more or less
south, and, taking the parallels in which the ship had
foundered as a starting-point, every degree the boat
made southwards would furnish an appreciable change
of temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The rum had worked beneficially in Johnson, who
now began to stretch his body and look about him.</p>

<p>“Another calm, master,” he said, in a voice to which
the dryness of his throat imparted a harsh unnatural
tone. “I thought I was dead and gone just now.
God help us! I don’t think none of us three’ll live to
talk of this here time!”</p>

<p>“We must put that poor body overboard,” said
Holdsworth. “It isn’t fit that her child should see her
like that. Will you take him for’ard and stand between
him and me, so that he can’t see what I’m doing, and
talk to him a bit? I almost wish they had both died
together. The sight of his sufferings makes mine more
than I can bear.”</p>

<p>He stifled a sob, and Johnson getting up languidly
and holding on to the gunwale of the boat with one
hand, took the boy by the arm and led him into the
bows.</p>

<p>Holdsworth slackened off the halliards to lower the
sail and screen the after part of the boat from the boy’s
sight. He then, with what strength he had, and as
quickly as he could, raised the dead body and let it slip
over the stern, muttering a simple prayer as he did so,
that God would let her meet her child in heaven, where
they would never more be parted; and then turned his
back upon the water and hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p>At the end of five minutes he stole a glance astern&mdash;the
body had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Four,” he muttered, “and three more to go! O
God, what work&mdash;what work this has been!”</p>

<p>His thoughts went to Dolly. If he died, what would
become of her? Not for many days yet, even supposing
the other boats should make their way to land or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
be rescued by a passing ship, would the news of the
“Meteor’s” loss reach her; and he thought of her
praying night and morning for him, straining her fond
eyes into the dim future, where the coming summer was,
with all its flowers and its sunshine; where the happy
day was that should bring him to her. If the news of
the shipwreck ever reached her, how would her gentle
spirit support the blow! But worse would it be if she
remained ignorant of her loss; because in that case she
would live on in hope for months and months, wakening
every morning with the idea that&mdash;To-day he may
come! to-day he may come! until hope sickened and
despair should bring cruel assurance of eternal separation&mdash;the
more unendurable because she should not
know <i>why</i> he did not come&mdash;whether he were living or
dead&mdash;whether he were true or false to her!</p>

<p>Oh for the power of giving peace to that manly unoffending
heart!</p>

<p>We shed tears, and well we may, God knows, over
the privations of shipwrecked men, over the hunger and
thirst and the mortal bodily agonies of poor souls
doomed to die a lingering and shocking death in open
boats, storm-tossed, or baking in breathless calms under
the burning eye of the sun; but do we think of that
deeper misery of theirs&mdash;that poignant mental torture
compared to which the sufferings of the flesh are as
naught&mdash;the thoughts of those they shall see no more&mdash;of
wives, and sisters, and mothers, and little children,
many of whom may perchance never hear the story of
their fate, and can have no tear for the famine and the
thirst that wasted the flesh off their skins and submitted
them to greater torture than the heart can bear to
think of?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Holdsworth had believed that the sufferings of the
boy would engross all his thoughts in himself, and that
though he might miss he would not cry for his mother.
But he was deceived; for, no sooner had the little
fellow discovered that she was gone from her place in
the bottom of the boat, than he uttered a sharp cry, and
asked Holdsworth where his mamma was.</p>

<p>Holdsworth took him upon his knee, but could not
answer. The child persisted in his inquiries, looking
the while suspiciously and eagerly about him, particularly
over the stern, where he had remembered seeing the
actor disappear.</p>

<p>“She is gone to God,” Holdsworth said at last. “My
little man, you will meet her again.”</p>

<p>“To God!” cried the child. “That’s where papa is!”</p>

<p>He looked up with startled eyes at the sky, and then
sobbed passionately, “Has she left me alone? has she
left me alone?”</p>

<p>“No, she has left you to me. Be a good boy now,
and don’t cry, and I will take care of you, and love you
dearly.”</p>

<p>His words smote him as the idlest mockery; but
apart from his mental sufferings, the mere effort of
raising his voice pained him intensely. He put the
child down, forcing a smile which seemed no better than
a grin of pain upon his emaciated face, and then stood
up to sweep the horizon, but soon sank down again with
a sound as of a clanging of bells in his ears, and his
throat constricted and burning with a dry, feverish heat,
the pain of which was exquisite.</p>

<p>He was now sensible that his memory was going, for
in trying to think of the child’s name he found that he
could not recall it. But this, somehow, gave him no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
concern, for his whole physical being was in perfect
accord with such lapses of the intellectual faculties, and
the discovery bred not the lightest movement of surprise
or apprehension in his mind.</p>

<p>At noon, Johnson asked for more rum, and Holdsworth
measured out a small quantity for the three of
them, diluting the draught, as he had before done, with
a few drops of salt water.</p>

<p>The boy never moved from the seat where he had
been placed by Holdsworth; he knew not, in reality,
where his mother had gone, but there was plainly a
suspicion in him that she was in the sea, and he kept
his eyes fixed on the water, as though in expectation of
her rising at the side of the boat. He shed no more
tears; indeed, physical weakness had so far conquered
him, that it had rendered him incapable of tears. The
sight of his white, young, piteous face, his head moving
on his shoulders in convulsive jerks, and his helpless
down-hanging arms, was enough to make one pray to
God that death might remove him speedily, if the term
of horrible misery were not to be ended at once.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed, and the sun went down behind
a calm sea. While the crimson flush still lived in the
sky, a flock of sea birds came from the south, and
hovered awhile over the boat, as though irresolute to
quit it for their further destination. They were at too
great an elevation to enable the men to judge what birds
they were; but they emitted harsh sounds, resembling
in some measure the cry of gulls, mixed with the rough
intonation of rooks. After this pause, they pursued
their flight, and soon winged themselves out of view,
but not without leaving behind them a species of desolate
hope, such as would be excited in the minds of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
who had been long banished from the sight of living
things, and by whom the most trivial incident would be
interpreted as an auspicious omen.</p>

<p>Holdsworth and Johnson drew together and spoke of
what these birds portended. The wildest phantasies
were begotten, and they sought to encourage themselves
with dreams which a listener would have shuddered over
as the babbling of delirium. Their thoughts being
loosened, they presently began to complain of hunger;
and Johnson took up a piece of the pulpy biscuit which
lay on a thwart and which the sun had hardened, and
bit it, but instantly ejected it, saying that it was bitterer
than gall. Indeed, had there been more light they would
have seen the frost-like crystals of salt which had been
dried into the biscuit by the sun’s action. However,
their hunger was not so fierce but that they could endure
it yet awhile.</p>

<p>The night came down, quite radiant with stars, with
not a cloud in all the great dome of glittering sky. The
two men were now so regardless of their fate that they
entered into no arrangement as to keeping watch, but
folded their arms upon their breasts and slept or fell
into a semi-unconscious state&mdash;lethargies so sinister that
it was hard to tell whether they were not the sloping
ways to death. Fitful cries sometimes broke from them,
resembling the echoes which are awakened in the caverns
of a bird-frequented cliff; but with notes of human
anguish in them that made the glory of the stars a
hellish mockery.</p>

<p>The boy slipped from his seat and lay prone at the
bottom of the boat, unheeded by either Holdsworth or
Johnson.</p>

<p>So passed the night.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SIXTH AND SEVENTH DAYS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The dawn awoke Johnson, who remained seated for
some time motionless, with his open eyes fixed upon the
sea half-way to the horizon. As he continued gazing,
a wild smile of joy kindled up his face and parted his
cracked lips into a grin so extravagant, so indescribable,
that it converted his face into a likeness of humanity as
repulsive and unreal as an ugly paper mask.</p>

<p>He thrust his bony fingers into Holdsworth’s collar
and shook him violently, whilst he pointed to the sea
with his right hand.</p>

<p>“Look! look!” he cried. “Wake up! wake up!
there is the land! See the houses, master! and the
trees!... O Jesus! how green they are! Wake up,
I say!”</p>

<p>Holdsworth started up violently and shook himself,
with a mighty effort, clear of the benumbing torpor that
had weighed him down throughout the night. He
stared in the direction indicated by Johnson, then
rubbed his eyes furiously with his knuckles, and stared
again, but could see nothing but the ocean growing blue
under the gathering light in the east, and stretching its
illimitable surface to the horizon.</p>

<p>“Come, master, let’s get the oars out. Why, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
have we drifted? O Lord, see the trees! how green
and beautiful! I reckon there’s water there&mdash;and I’ll
strip and souse in it! Will they see us? Wave your
hat!”</p>

<p>He took off his own and brandished it furiously.
But all on a sudden he let fall his arm&mdash;he stretched
his head forward, and his glassy eyes seemed to protrude
from their sockets; his breath went and came shrilly
through his open mouth; and then, giving a scream, he
shrieked, “It’s gone! it’s gone!” and as if the disappointment
were a blow dealt him by some heavy instrument,
he gave a great gasp, collapsed, and fell like a
bundle of rags from his seat.</p>

<p>The fit of convulsive trembling that had seized Holdsworth
passed; he caught sight of the boy lying on his
side, with his eyes, wide open, fixed upon his face.
The child was pointing to his throat. Holdsworth
raised him and laid him along the seat, not conceiving
that the little creature had fallen from his resting-place
during the night, but that he had placed himself in that
position the better to rest his limbs.</p>

<p>He moistened his lips with rum, but on looking
attentively at his face, perceived indications denoting
approaching death as clearly as though the piteous
message was written upon his brow. This perception
gave him exquisite misery. The bright eyes of the
child, suggesting sweet memories of the little wife he
had left at Southbourne, had endeared the boy to him;
he had been his playmate and companion on the
“Meteor;” he had watched the deep and beautiful love
of the mother; and her death, recent as it was, had
imparted the deepest pathos to the little orphan, and
made his claims upon Holdsworth’s protection and love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
infinitely eloquent and appealing. That he should be
dying now&mdash;now that the bright sun was climbing the
brilliant morning sky&mdash;dying for want of a cup of
water, a morsel of bread&mdash;dying without a mother’s love
to enfold him in his last struggle and waft his young
and innocent soul to God on the wings of a prayer, such
as <i>her</i> agony, <i>her</i> devotion only could dictate&mdash;oh, it
was too pitiful!</p>

<p>“My little boy&mdash;look up!&mdash;tell me&mdash;do you suffer?
Where is the pain? Is it in your throat? Oh my
poor innocent!”</p>

<p>His tears blinded him. He took his handkerchief
and dipped it into the sea and laid it upon the child’s
throat.</p>

<p>The little creature seemed to feel his love, for he
made a movement as if he would nestle against him,
and smiled wanly, but could not speak. His young
dying face was an unbearable sight, and Holdsworth,
groaning, gazed wildly around the horizon as if there&mdash;or
there&mdash;or there&mdash;must be the ship sent by God to
save the boy’s life!</p>

<p>A long hour passed; the child still lived, and Holdsworth
hung over him, heedless of the other poor creature
who had awakened to consciousness, but yet lay in a heap,
supporting his head against the stanchion of a thwart,
and watching his companions with glazed eyes. Then
a craving for food mastered Holdsworth, and he looked
at the biscuit, but had yet sufficient control over himself
not to touch it, knowing the penalty of increased thirst
that must follow the absorption of the brine into his
stomach. He went to the locker and plunged his arm
into the water that half filled it, and groped about in
search of he knew not what; something to appease his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
craving might be there; but he found nothing but slimy
pieces of biscuit and the broken bottles.</p>

<p>In a sudden fury of hunger he tore off his boot and
cut a piece of the leather from the top of it, and began
to chew it.</p>

<p>The mere act of mastication somewhat diminished
his suffering, and he returned to the boy. No marked
change had occurred within the hour, but, imperceptible
as the departure might be, it was only too evident that
the child was dying. Thirst, exposure, and grief&mdash;for
there had been something so akin to a heart-broken
expression in the little fellow’s eyes when he stared at
the sea, expecting his mother to rise from it, that it
would be impossible to doubt the keenness of his sorrow&mdash;these
things had done their work.</p>

<p>Holdsworth bathed his face and throat with salt
water, and again offered to moisten his lips with rum;
but the boy made a gesture of dissent. Indeed the rum
served no other end than to irritate his lips and his
tongue, which was swollen and discoloured.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, the torment of thirst abated in
Holdsworth, and Johnson also seemed to suffer less.
The first agony which thirst brings with it, and which
endures for two or three days, was passing; the next
stage would be a kind of insensibility to the craving for
water; but this would presently be followed by a renewal
of the suffering in its sharpest form, which would
continue until death ended it.</p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon, Holdsworth remained at
the side of the boy, who lay with half-closed eyes and
no movement of the body, save the faint rise and fall of
his chest as he breathed. They were neither of them
much more than skeletons, and so ashen was the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>plexion
of Holdsworth, so lustreless his eyes, so wild and
gaunt and ragged his whole face with the grisly beard,
the white lips, the livid hollows beneath the eyes, and
the twisted knotted hair upon his forehead and down
his back, that he seemed much nearer to death than the
child, whose infancy saved his face from being made
actually repulsive by suffering.</p>

<p>Before sunset the boy became delirious, and mouthed
shocking gibberish, being unable to articulate. For a
whole half-hour this babbling lasted, and then died out,
and the boy grew conscious. Holdsworth supported his
head on his knee, but he slightly twisted it round to
look at the sun, which was just then resting, a great
orb of burning gold, upon the line of the horizon. He
watched the sun intently, undazzled by the splendour,
until it vanished, when he uttered a low wailing cry
and stretched his arms out to it. Holdsworth felt his
little body trembling, and some convulsive movements
passed through him. Holdsworth kissed his forehead,
and the boy smiled, and with that smile his spirit
passed away.</p>

<p>When he could not doubt that he was dead, Holdsworth
removed the little jacket from the child’s back,
covered his face with it, and laid him in the bottom of
the boat.</p>

<p>The mere exertion of doing this made him fall half-swooning
upon a seat, on which Johnson came staggering
over the thwarts and gave him some rum. There
was now no more than a quarter of a pint left in the
bottle.</p>

<p>“Master,” said the man, bringing his lips close to
Holdsworth’s ear, “if I die first, please throw my body
overboard. I don’t like the notion of drifting about in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
this boat maybe for weeks, and becoming a sight not fit
to be looked at, if e’er a ship should come by.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t live to do you that service,” muttered
Holdsworth. “I don’t feel as if I could last out much
longer.”</p>

<p>“The curse of God is on us!” said Johnson.
“There’s nothing but calms, and to think of two being
left out o’ seven!”</p>

<p>The night fell quickly. At about ten o’clock a
breeze came up from the north, and blew coolly and
gratefully over the burning heads of the two men. It
took the boat aback, and Holdsworth, acting from sheer
instinct, put her before it, and hauling the sheet aft,
steered east. No clouds came up with the wind; it
was a summer breeze which might lull at any moment,
or veer round, perhaps, to the south-west, and bring up
a change of weather.</p>

<p>Lying pretty close to the wind the boat required no
steering, which was fortunate, for the yoke-lines soon
slipped out of Holdsworth’s hands, and a torpor stole
over him, which, without actually suspending his consciousness,
rendered his perceptions dreamy and useless.
He rested with his back against the side of the boat, his
head upon his breast, and his eyes half closed. Johnson
crouched near the mast.</p>

<p>The breeze proved steady during the night, but died
away towards the small hours; then, at daybreak, sprang
up afresh from the west. The heeling over of the boat
aroused the two men, who languidly, and with gestures
terribly significant of their growing indifference to their
fate, dipped the sail, and again let the boat lie close to
save the trouble of steering her.</p>

<p>When the morning was a little advanced, Johnson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
crept to the side of the dead boy and groped about
him.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” cried Holdsworth fiercely.</p>

<p>“Feeling if there isn’t a piece of ship’s bread in his
pockets,” answered the man doggedly, and looking up
with a wolfish light in his sunken eyes.</p>

<p>“Let him alone!” said Holdsworth.</p>

<p>The man dragged himself away reluctantly, grumbling
to himself, and resumed his place near the mast,
keeping his eye steadfastly fixed on the dead body.</p>

<p>A sick shudder passed through Holdsworth as he
observed the man’s peculiar stare, and sinking on his
knees, he uncovered the child’s face and inspected it
attentively, to satisfy himself that he was actually dead.
He then raised him in his arms with the intention of
casting him overboard. But Johnson came scrambling
over to him and gripped him by the wrist.</p>

<p>The expression of his face, made devilish by suffering,
was heightened to the horribly grotesque by the
action of his mouth, which gaped and contorted ere he
could articulate.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do? Keep him!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Why?” answered Holdsworth, looking him full in
the face.</p>

<p>But the man could not deliver the idea that was in
his mind; he could only <i>look</i> it.</p>

<p>Holdsworth turned his back upon him and raised his
burden on a level with the boat’s gunwale, but Johnson
grasped the body with both hands.</p>

<p>“Let go!” said Holdsworth.</p>

<p>The man with an oath retained his hold. Weak as
Holdsworth was, the passion that boiled in him at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
desecration the half-maddened wretch was doing his
poor little favourite, gave him temporarily back his old
strength. He raised his foot, and, planting it in Johnson’s
chest hurled him back; the man fell with a crash
over the thwart, and lay stunned.</p>

<p>Holdsworth leaned over the boat’s side and let the
body gently sink in the water; which done, he felt that
his own turn was come, and dropped in the stern-sheets
groaning, with drops in his eyes that scalded them.</p>

<p>But he still lived, and whilst his heart beat nature
would assert herself. Towards the afternoon a torturing
craving for food beset him, started him into life, and
made him sit upright. He wiped the foam from his lips
and beheld it discoloured with blood. He looked
savagely around him like a wild beast, and, beholding
nothing but the dry, bare seats, the boat’s hot interior
with the gratings whitened by the heat of the sun, and
underneath them the glistening water that bubbled
coolly and with a maddening suggestion of sparkling,
refreshing springs, he dragged his knife from his pocket,
pierced his arm, and put his lips to the wound.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />

<span class="smaller">THE TENTH DAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was morning on the tenth day, dating from the
foundering of the “Meteor.”</p>

<p>A barque of about six hundred tons, named the
“Jessie Maxwell,” three weeks out from the port of
Glasgow, having been becalmed all night, was standing
south, with all sail set, and a gentle breeze on the
beam.</p>

<p>It was the second officer’s watch on deck; he was
sitting trimming his nails on the grating abaft the wheel,
when the man who was steering, pointing to the horizon
a few points before the port beam, asked him if he
could see anything black there. The second officer not
having very good sight, stared awhile and declared that
he saw nothing; then, going forward, called to a man
in the main-top to tell him if there was anything to be
seen on the port beam. The man, shading his eyes,
sang out that he could see a black object, but whether
it was a boat or a piece of wreck he couldn’t say.
Whereupon Mr. Anderson stepped to the companion-hatchway,
took down the glass, and, having adjusted it
to his sight, levelled it.</p>

<p>“By thunder!” he cried, keeping the glass to his
eye, “it’s a boat&mdash;and there’s a mast, and a lug-sail&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
something black at the mast head. But the de’il a
soul can I make out aboard of her.”</p>

<p>He had another good look, and then, tucking the
glass under his arm, went below.</p>

<p>In about three minutes’ time he returned, followed
by a small stout man with a good-humoured face, and a
grave, middle-aged gentleman with a long black beard.</p>

<p>“There, sir; there she is yonder!” said Mr. Anderson,
incapable of seeing her with his naked eye, but
concluding that she must still be where he had at first
sighted her, and willing to obtain the credit of a good
sight by a simple device.</p>

<p>“I see something black,” said the grave gentleman.</p>

<p>“Give us the glass!” exclaimed the short man, who
was the skipper, and applied the telescope to his eye.
“It is certainly a boat,” he observed, after a bit; “but
I don’t see anybody moving in her. What’s that black
thing at the mast-head? Is it a signal?”</p>

<p>He turned to the man at the wheel: “Starboard
your helm. Mr. Anderson, trim the yards. Yonder
may be some perishing human beings.”</p>

<p>The whisper soon went through the vessel that there
was a boat in sight; the watch below turned out of
their hammocks and came on deck; and soon the forecastle
was lively with a crowd of hands gazing earnestly
at the boat, which the alteration in the barque’s course
now made distinguishable, and speculating as to the
people who were on board of her.</p>

<p>“She looks to me like a ship’s quarter-boat,” said the
skipper, with his eye to the glass. “The sheet of the
sail is to windward, and she’s driving bodily to leeward.
What in the name of conscience is the meaning of that
black flag at the mast-head?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>They neared her rapidly, but were puzzled to discover
no living thing stirring in her, for though it was
perfectly true that the sail had not been dipped, she
had all the appearance of being manned. The water
was so calm that the barque was able to run almost
alongside the boat. There was a rush to the vessel’s
side, and then, as the boat was passed at a distance of
forty or fifty feet, cries rose from the forecastle: “There’s
a man in the stern-sheets!”</p>

<p>“Do you see him, sir, lying with his head under the
aftermost thwart?”</p>

<p>“There’s two of them! See there&mdash;hard agin’ the
mast!”</p>

<p>The boat dropped astern and revealed her interior
to the people aft.</p>

<p>“My God! Two corpses in her!” cried the second
mate.</p>

<p>“Man the starboard fore braces!” shouted the
skipper.</p>

<p>The wheel flew round; the port fore-braces were
let go, and the yards backed. The vessel’s way was
stopped and a dozen hands came aft to lower away the
port quarter boat. In jumped four men, the second
mate at the tiller. “Lower away!” Down sank the
boat, soused upon the water, the blocks were unhooked,
out flew the oars.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the boat was alongside the coffin
with the black flag at her mast-head. The men grabbed
her gunwale, and stood up to look in.</p>

<p>God in Heaven! what a scene!</p>

<p>Holdsworth lay on his back, his legs bent double
under him, his arms stretched out, and his ghastly face
upturned directly under a thwart. Johnson lay in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
heap near the mast, and they thought him at first a
bundle of clothes, until they caught sight of his hair
and the fingers of one hand. <i>His</i> face was hidden; but
Holdsworth looked a gray and famished skeleton, with
God’s signal of humanity eaten by suffering out of his
face; his wrists, like white sticks, covered with sores,
one foot naked, and the skin of that and of his face of
the complexion and aspect of old parchment.</p>

<p>Crumbling fragments of salted biscuit were scattered
on one of the seats. Aft was the open locker half-filled
with water, coloured like pea-soup by the ship’s bread
that was soaked and partially dissolved in it. In the
bows were the empty kegs with the bungs out, and as the
boat swayed to and fro to the movements of the small
waves with which the wind had crisped the sea, these
kegs rolled against each other with hollow sounds.</p>

<p>The dry, baked appearance of the boat, the fragments
of biscuit, the empty kegs, and the skeleton men, formed
a spectacle of horror and extreme misery, such as the
wildest imagination could not realise without memory
and experience to help it. Nor in this picture of pure
ghastliness was the least ghastly item the black shawl,
which fluttered its sable folds at the mast-head, and to
the sailors typified, as no other image could, the character
and quality of the horror they contemplated.</p>

<p>“Can they be dead?” gasped one of the sailors, whose
white face showed him almost overcome.</p>

<p>“Mr. Anderson!” came a voice from the barque’s
quarter-deck, “take the boat in tow and bring her alongside.”</p>

<p>They made the painter fast to their stern, lowered
her sail, and started with their grim burden gliding after
them. The voices of the men overhanging the vessel’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
bulwarks rose in a low, deep hum, when the boat was
near enough to enable them to see its contents again.
The port gangway was unshipped, and some hands stood
by with lines to hoist the bodies inboard.</p>

<p>“Do they live?” called out the skipper.</p>

<p>“They both seem dead, sir,” answered Anderson.</p>

<p>The boat was now brought right under the gangway,
and the top of her mast being level with the bulwarks,
submitted the shawl to the close scrutiny of the sailors.
They examined it with awe and curiosity.</p>

<p>“It isn’t bunting,” said one.</p>

<p>“It looks like bunting too!” exclaimed another.</p>

<p>“See how it’s rigged up!” observed a third; “hitched
on anyways.”</p>

<p>“If it ain’t a woman’s dress tore in two, I give it
up,” said a fourth, “though there ain’t no woman in the
boat as I can make out.”</p>

<p>By this time they were slinging Johnson under the
arms and around the middle, ready to be hoisted over
the gangway. Now that he was exposed, he made a
more gaunt and sickening object than Holdsworth. He
was an image of famine&mdash;of manhood killed by suffering&mdash;a
picture such as the memory would retain when
years had impaired its powers, and driven all other
vivid impressions from it. The men fell back as the
piteous object was reverently raised over the vessel’s
side, and placed upon a sail near the main-hatchway.
Then followed the form of Holdsworth.</p>

<p>The captain and the gentleman with the long beard
approached the two bodies.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me if there’s any life in them, Mr.
Sherman?” said the captain.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman knelt and examined the two faces. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
seamen pressed eagerly around to listen. The elements
of the picturesque and the tragical entered so deeply into
the scene as to make it extraordinarily impressive&mdash;the
brown and rugged features of the sailors; the grave
figure kneeling; the two bodies on their backs resembling
skeletons poorly disguised by a rude imitation of
human skin; the black shawl streaming alongside, symbolising
a story of cruel, lingering, horrible death; above,
the white sails of the vessel, and over all a beaming sky
and a joyous sun! And add the mysteriousness of these
famished and motionless visitants&mdash;their name, their
country, their story unknown&mdash;their white lips sealed!</p>

<p>“What do you think?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“This man,” answered Mr. Sherman, indicating Johnson,
“is certainly dead; and in my opinion&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But at that moment the feeblest of feeble tremors
passed through Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“Quick!” cried Mr. Sherman, springing to his feet.
“This man lives; they may both be alive! Have them
taken below, Captain Duff! Quick, sir! every moment
is precious!”</p>

<p>His excitement was contagious. The captain bellowed
for the steward. Others seized upon the bodies and
hurried aft with them. The murmur of many voices
rose and swelled into a hubbub.</p>

<p>“Aft here to the davits, and hoist the boat up!”
sang out the second mate; who, while this was doing,
went below to take instructions as to the other boat,
and returned with orders to get it inboard.</p>

<p>The curiosity of the men to handle and examine this
boat was so great, that when the order was given for
some hands to get into her, the whole ship’s company
made a rush to the gangway. But this tumult was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
quelled by the help of a few Scotch curses. The boat
was hauled round to the starboard side, and tackles
rigged on to the fore and main yard-arms. Up came
the boat cheerily, with her mast unshipped, and was
lashed athwart-ships just before the main-hatchway.
The vessel’s yards were then trimmed, and away she
slipped through the water.</p>

<p>The hands could not be got away from the boat.
Had she been the fossilised remnant of some antediluvian
Armada, she could not have been examined by the
men with more intense and breathless curiosity. There
was no name on her, no clue of any kind to tell the ship
she had belonged to, where she was built, what port she
hailed from. There was, indeed, the word “London,”
together with some figures branded upon the kegs; but
this indicated nothing. They dragged the soaking bags
of biscuit out of the locker, where they also found the
fragments of the rum-bottles; and deep and numerous
were the ejaculations these simple things called forth
from the sailors, who gathered a story from them of
which my hand is powerless to impart the thrilling
pathos to my unvarnished version.</p>

<p>“See here!” said a man, shaking the kegs; “not a
drain of water in them!”</p>

<p>“Here’s a boot with a piece cut clean out from the
top of it,” said another.</p>

<p>“Some one has tried to make food out o’ that!”
said an old salt, shaking a quantity of ringlets. “I’ve
heerd tell of worse stuff nor boots being eat by castaway
men!”</p>

<p>The fragments of dried biscuit were passed around
and examined with wondering attention. The sail, the
oars, the gratings&mdash;all came in for their share of closest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and absorbed scrutiny. But the object that most excited
speculation was the poor widow’s shawl, which, having
been drenched and dried, and drenched and dried again,
had become rotten, was full of holes, and as much
resembled a shawl as a waistcoat.</p>

<p>“If this ain’t a curio, I should like to know what
is!” said a seaman.</p>

<p>“It’s a bit of a gownd, that’s what <i>I</i> say it is!”
exclaimed another authoritatively. “Think I can’t tell
what a woman’s dress is like?”</p>

<p>“My notion is,” said an old man, standing aloof,
“that there ain’t nothing mortal about it at all, but
that it’s just a bit of bunting hoisted by death, to let
the people as was in the boat know who their proper
skipper was. I hope nobody means to bring it into the
forecastle. I’ll not go a-nigh it for one.”</p>

<p>“Bring that thing aft here!” called Anderson; “and
turn to there and get about your work.”</p>

<p>The men dispersed, and the watch below rolled into
the forecastle, talking under their breaths, and making
each other miserable with horrid legends of fire, disease,
drowning, and starvation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The night came. The “Jessie Maxwell” was heeling
over to a spanking breeze, and in her cabin the lamp
was lighted, and Captain Duff and his chief officer, an
Orkney Islander named Banks, a huge, rough, shaggy,
honest-looking being, as like a Newfoundland dog as it
is possible for a man to be, sat, each with a big glass of
whisky and water at his elbow, smoking pipes.</p>

<p>Here was a very different interior from what the
“Meteor” had presented. The cabin was about twenty
feet long and six feet high, with a broad skylight overhead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and half a dozen sleeping berths around. No gilt
and cream colour, nor polished panels, nor Brussels
carpets, nor the hundred elegancies of decoration and
furniture, that made the “Meteor’s” cuddy as pretty as
a drawing-room, were to be found; but solid snuff-coloured
doors, with stout hair-cushioned sofas on either
side the table that travelled up and down a couple of
portly stanchions, so that, when it was not wanted,
it could be stowed out of the road. But how suggestive,
every plank and beam that met the eye, of strength and
durability! Here was a vessel fit to trade in any seas,
well manned, with a snugly-stowed cargo, not a quarter
of a ton in excess of what she ought to carry, commanded
by a shrewd and able seaman out of Glasgow,
and by two mates as competent as himself.</p>

<p>The steam from the toddy mingled the fragrance of
lemon and honest Glenlivet with the more defined
aroma of cavendish tobacco. The captain sat on one
sofa and Banks on the other; and they smoked and
sipped, and looked steadfastly on one another, as if time
were altogether too precious to be wasted in conversation,
which must oblige them to devote their lips to
other purposes than the pipe-stem and the tumbler.</p>

<p>“I think I did well to get that boat inboard,” said
the skipper presently; “a boat’s a boat.”</p>

<p>There was no controverting this position; so Mr.
Banks acquiesced with a nod, which he executed like
Jove, in a cloud.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the time, Banks,” observed the
skipper after a long pause, “when little Angus McKay
spun us that yarn in the “Bannockburn,” about his
falling in with a ship’s long-boat off the Cape of Good
Hope, with a nigger boy and three sheep aboard of her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Banks, after deep deliberation, replied that he
minded the story weel.</p>

<p>“A verra curious circumstance,” continued the
skipper, “if it wasn’t a lee!”</p>

<p>Another pause, during which the two men sucked
their pipes, never remitting their steadfast gaze at each
other, unless to turn their eyes upon the tumblers before
raising them to their lips.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sherman seems to know what he is about,”
said Captain Duff. “He has a fund of humanity in his
bosom, and I like to reflect, sir, on his sitting by the
poor de’il’s bed watching by him as though he were his
ain son.”</p>

<p>Nothing could have been more <i>à propos</i> than this
remark, if it were designed to reach the ear of the
gentleman referred to; for, as the captain spoke, one of
the snuff-coloured doors was opened, and Mr. Sherman
came out.</p>

<p>“Hoo’s the patient?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“He has his senses, though there is such a bewildered
look on his face as I don’t think I ever saw on the
human countenance,” replied Mr. Sherman, seating himself
near the skipper, and looking about for a tumbler;
whereat Mr. Banks called in a hurricane-note for “Atam,”
meaning Adam. A small red-headed man emerged from
somewhere and placed the materials for a glass of
whisky toddy before Mr. Sherman.</p>

<p>“Ech!” ejaculated the skipper, “I daresay he is
puzzled. So would I be if my last memory left me
starving in an open boat and my next one found me
warm in bed with the flavour of old Nantz brandy in
my inside.”</p>

<p>“I have asked him no questions,” continued Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Sherman. “I know enough of doctoring to understand
that his life may depend upon rest and silence.”</p>

<p>“My word, sir, you are a very gude-hearted man!”
exclaimed the skipper; “and if ever I am shipwrecked,
may it be my luck to fall into just such hands as yours.
Your health, sir.”</p>

<p>Saying which, he half-emptied his tumbler, a performance
that made his merry eyes glisten with delight.</p>

<p>“And the other man is ted?” said Mr. Banks.</p>

<p>“Quite dead, poor soul! Did you ever see anything
more heart-rending than his body, captain? Mere skin
and bone&mdash;and, oh! sir, the expression of his face!”
exclaimed Mr. Sherman, holding his hands over his eyes
a moment.</p>

<p>“Thirst is an awfu’ thing,” said the skipper, glancing
at his tumbler.</p>

<p>“And so is hunger,” observed Mr. Banks, who
looked as though a whole ox might hardly serve him
for a meal.</p>

<p>“I expect, when the other poor fellow is capable of
speaking, that we shall hear a terrible tale,” said Mr.
Sherman. “It is very providential that my slight
knowledge of medicine should qualify me to deal with
him. The greatest care is required in treating persons
nearly dead of starvation. I have fed him so far in
spoonfuls only. It is my intention to remain with him
through the night. I’ll borrow one of your easy-chairs,
captain, which will serve me very well for a bed.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I am sleeping close at hand, and if you
want me, just give my cot a shove, and I’ll be out of it
before you can tell which side I drop from.”</p>

<p>This settled, the captain mixed himself another
tumbler of spirits, refilled his pipe, and entered into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
speculations as to Holdsworth’s nationality, the length
of time he had been in the boat, the probable longitude
and latitude in which the ship had taken fire or foundered,
with many other matters, all of which he relieved
with long pauses, and a variety of thoughtful puffs and
attentive glances at the light through the medium of
his tumbler. Presently four bells&mdash;ten o’clock&mdash;struck,
which made Mr. Banks rise from his seat, wish his companions
“Coot night,” and withdraw to his cabin to get
a couple of hours’ sleep before his watch came on. The
others remained chatting for half an hour, and then the
skipper went on deck to have a look around before
turning in for the night.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOLDSWORTH’S RECOVERY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The cabin in which Holdsworth lay was a spare one,
next the captain’s. It was lighted by an oblong piece
of frosted glass let into the deck overhead, and by a port-hole
which was a standing and comfortable illustration
of the immense thickness of the timbers that separated
the inmate from the sea. There was a square of cocoa-nut
matting on the deck to tread on; up in a corner
an immovable washstand, containing a pewter basin; a
row of pegs against the door; and a mahogany bunk.</p>

<p>In this bunk lay Holdsworth, and at the hour of
which I am now writing, Mr. Sherman sat beside him
in an easy-chair, his legs up and his head back, in
a deep sleep. From the centre of a beam hung a
small oil-lamp, the frame carefully protected by wire
network; and the light diffused by this lamp was clear
enough to exhibit Holdsworth’s face distinctly.</p>

<p>He, too, was asleep, if sleep that can be called which,
plunging the senses into unconsciousness, yet leaves
pain and misery to play their active part upon the
darkened stage of the mind. Of his youth, of his
beauty, I might almost say of his very manhood&mdash;such
as was wont to be suggested by the open, brave, and
winning expression of his face&mdash;not a trace was left.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
The spoliation of suffering had been so complete, that
the bare wreck of the noble temple it had ruined was
all that remained. Now, even more completely than in
his waking hours, might we master the full extent of
the cruel transformation that had been wrought, since
the candour of sleep was on the slumberer, and the self-consciousness
that masks the subtle facial truths, inactive.
His hair, formerly dark and luxuriant, was
thinned about the forehead, was tangled and coarse,
and mixed with gray and white. The protrusion of the
cheek-bones formed a conspicuous feature; under them
the flesh fell into a hollow, and, as much of it as the
bristly moustache and whiskers suffered to be seen, was
puckered and dried up like the rind of an old winter
apple. The under lip was enlarged, and entirely altered
the remembered aspect of the mouth. The eyebrows
drooped where they had formerly arched, and the hair
of them near the temples had fallen off. Time might,
perhaps, efface some of these disfigurements deep graven
by the stylet of pain; but no man could have looked
upon that sleeping face without a conviction of the permanency
of much that he beheld.</p>

<p>He slept; but though his slumber was deep, his
movements were so restless, convulsive, and feverish,
that it seemed every moment as if he must start up.</p>

<p>Once during the night the ship’s bell sounding seven
awakened him, and he opened his eyes and raised his
head, but soon let it fall again. Then it was during
this short interval of wakefulness that the bewildered
look of which Mr. Sherman had spoken might have
been perceived; and it lingered for some minutes on
his face after he had dropped asleep once more.</p>

<p>Several times during the night the kind-hearted man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
who watched by the poor fellow’s side rose from his
chair, and scrutinised him anxiously; and once Mr.
Banks popped his shaggy head in to ask how the sufferer
did, but found both patient and doctor asleep.</p>

<p>The morning crept over the sky, and turned the
port-hole and the piece of deck-glass white; and at six
o’clock Mr. Sherman woke, and crept quietly to his
cabin to refresh himself with a plunge in cold water;
then went on deck, where he found the captain smoking
a cigar, his feet in galoshes, and the hands washing
down. A sparkling, genial morning, with a warm
breeze from the west, the barque in full sail, and the
green seas caressing her bows, and leaping back from
their keen salute in avalanches of foam.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Sherman,” said the skipper.
“This is the weather, eh, sir? Out of the Doldrums
by Tuesday week, I hope. How’s your patient?”</p>

<p>“Sleeping soundly. He has passed a good night.
If he can only get over the next few days, the tropical
sun will set him to rights.”</p>

<p>“Is he awake now?”</p>

<p>“I think not. But we’ll go and see if you like.”</p>

<p>The captain threw away his cigar and followed Mr.
Sherman below, not, however, before casting a look
above and around, and singing out to the man at the
wheel to “keep her at that.”</p>

<p>Opening the cabin door they crept to the bunk and
stood looking at the sleeping man, who, aroused perhaps
by the magnetic influence of four eyes upon him, started
and stared up at them from his pillow.</p>

<p>Captain Duff drew back a step, scared a little by the
wild gaze that Holdsworth fixed upon him, and which
was made in some measure repellent by his gaunt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
wasted face, and by the pitiable expression of bewilderment
that passed slowly into it, and made it almost as
meaningless as an idiot’s.</p>

<p>“How do you feel, my poor fellow?” asked Mr.
Sherman; “stronger, I hope?”</p>

<p>Holdsworth made no answer, but knitted his brow
with an air of profound perplexity, gazed slowly round
him, then attentively at Mr. Sherman, then at the
skipper, then at himself, finally pressing his hand to
his head.</p>

<p>“How do you know he is English? Perhaps he
don’t understand you,” said Captain Duff.</p>

<p>“I heard him mutter in English before I joined you
last night,” answered Mr. Sherman.</p>

<p>“Pray tell me where I am?” said Holdsworth, in a
faint voice.</p>

<p>“That’s English!” exclaimed the captain, though he
looked as if he must take a thought of it yet, before he
should allow himself to feel sure.</p>

<p>“You are among friends,” replied Mr. Sherman
softly, and in a voice full of sympathy; “on board a
vessel called the ‘Jessie Maxwell,’ bound to Australia.
We sighted your boat yesterday morning.”</p>

<p>“My boat!” whispered Holdsworth, with an expression
on his face of such deep bewilderment that it was
painful to behold it.</p>

<p>“Do you not remember?”</p>

<p>“My boat! my boat!” repeated Holdsworth; but
no light came into his eyes to show that he apprehended
the other’s meaning.</p>

<p>“He has lost his memory,” said Mr. Sherman aside
to the captain. And then to Holdsworth: “Do you
feel as if you could eat anything?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, I am hungry,” answered Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“That is a good sign!” exclaimed Mr. Sherman,
cheerfully. “Captain, will you stop here a few minutes,
while I ask the steward to get the soup heated?”</p>

<p>The skipper, being left alone, stationed himself near
the door, and watched Holdsworth with mixed emotions.
Brave to foolhardiness in a gale of wind, on a lee-shore,
in confronting a mutinous crew, in dealing with the
severest of marine exigencies, this little gentleman, in
some trivial matters, was as timorous as a mouse, and
would have made his escape overboard, rather than be
grasped by Holdsworth, who, if he were not the dissembled
madman his ragged, withered face suggested
him to be, was still hedged about with enough of
mysterious and secret horror to make him awful in the
practical little Scotchman’s eyes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Holdsworth rested upon his pillow, casting
eager and restless glances about the cabin, and at
the skipper, and battling with an oblivion of the past
as thick and as impenetrable as that mystery of being
which the infant emerges from at its birth.</p>

<p>“Tell me, sir, who I am&mdash;where I have been taken
from!” he exclaimed, presently, looking with imploring
eyes at the skipper.</p>

<p>“Indeed, my man, I can’t tell you who you are,”
replied the captain, wishing that Mr. Sherman would
return, or that a squall would give him an excuse to
withdraw. “All that I know is, we found you in a
boat, and picked you up, and that the gentleman who
has just gone out, saved your life.”</p>

<p>“Strange!” muttered Holdsworth; “I remember
nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it will all come if you give it time. Memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
often leaves people after a bad illness, but returns again
with the strength. Ech!” he cried, struck, as though
for the first time, by the poor creature’s lean and hollow
face. “But you have kenn’d some awfu’ times, man,
since ye last stood upon honest shipboard. Sailoring,
if you are a sailor, is a poor look-out when it comes to
wanting bread and water.”</p>

<p>The door opened and Mr. Sherman came in, followed
by the steward bearing a dish of soup and some mild
brandy and water, with which Mr. Sherman proceeded
to feed Holdsworth. When as much of the soup as was
thought good had been administered, Mr. Sherman bade
his patient turn his back to the light and get some
sleep.</p>

<p>“I will, sir; thank you for your kindness,” returned
Holdsworth, with affecting docility. “But, first, will
you help me&mdash;will you help me to recall something&mdash;anything&mdash;to
give my mind rest? I can see nothing
for the darkness that is over me.”</p>

<p>“I have told him that his memory will come back
with his strength,” said Captain Duff.</p>

<p>“Yes, have a little patience!” exclaimed Mr. Sherman.
“We will get you on deck in a day or two, and
when you see the boat we took you from your memory
will return to you.”</p>

<p>“Can you not tell me my name?” asked Holdsworth,
with that striking expression of painful anxiety you may
see on the face of a blind man deserted by his guide
and totally at fault.</p>

<p>“We will endeavour to find it out,” replied Mr.
Sherman. “Come, captain, our friend must talk no
more, or all our trouble to get him well will be of no
use.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Holdsworth put out his hand with a smile of gratitude
that softened and almost sweetened his miserable
and skeleton-like face; then turned in his bunk and
closed his eyes.</p>

<p>“A strange thing to happen to a man,” said the captain
to Mr. Sherman, as they went on deck. “I never
could have believed that the memory of a creature could
go out of his brain like that!”</p>

<p>“We may guess the nature and magnitude of his sufferings
by this effect,” answered Mr. Sherman. “God alone
knows how many days he may have passed in that boat,
and what scenes of horror he has witnessed and what
torments he has endured. But we must help his memory
as far as he can. Will you allow me to go forward and
examine the boat?”</p>

<p>They walked to the main-deck, where the boat was
stowed. A little knot of men gathered around and
watched their movements with interest. But, in truth,
the boat was as unsuggestive as a sheet of blank paper.
There was no name in her; nor by her build, sail, oars,
shape, or anything else, was it possible to tell her paternity.
The broken bottles and bags of bread that had
been fished out of her locker were in her bottom, but
no clue was to be got from them; nothing but a story
of deepest tragical misery. The captain sent for the
shawl that had been unhitched from the mast-head, and
he and Mr. Sherman held it open between them and
inspected it. Browned by the wet and the heat&mdash;in its
frayed and tattered shape, its very texture modified by
exposure&mdash;it was positively no more than a black rag.</p>

<p>They returned to the after-deck, and sent the steward
for the clothes which had been removed from the two
men. Holdsworth’s pilot coat was of good quality, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
his linen also seemed to suggest that he had held a very
superior position to that of Johnson, whose dress was a
sailor’s, a brown woollen shirt, serge trousers, boots with
high tops, and the invariable belt and knife. Holdsworth’s
linen was marked with H; nothing more. They
found in his pockets a watch, a clasp-knife, some money,
and one or two other articles, which Mr. Sherman made
into a parcel, hoping that the sight of things which
would be familiar might help the poor fellow’s memory.</p>

<p>“It is evident,” says the skipper, “that whatever we
are to learn must come from the man himself. His
clothes tell us nothing.”</p>

<p>“They are a sailor’s, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“Why, they are such clothes as I or Banks might
wear; but that don’t prove that the man was a sailor.
He certainly hasn’t a nautical cut.”</p>

<p>“His language is that of an educated man, and his
linen is that of a gentleman. Pray God that the poor
soul’s memory will return. Without it he will be scarcely
better off with us than he was in the boat.”</p>

<p>“Eh?” cried the literal skipper, “not better off with
good meat and drink and a good bunk to lie in, than
when he was perishing of thirst, with no better blanket
than the sky to cover him?”</p>

<p>“I mean that he may have friends at home who,
while his memory remains torpid, must be as dead to him
and he to them, as if he had remained in his open boat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see your idea, sir,” replied the skipper.
“And now about the other puir creature. We must
bury him this morning. He is dead you say?”</p>

<p>“We will go and look at him.”</p>

<p>“Why,” returned Captain Duff, shrinking, “to tell
you the plain truth, I am not over fond of these girning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
bodies. By your leave, sir, I’ll hae the puir creature
sewn up in canvas, and if you’ll tak’ the reading of the
Burial office I shall feel obliged, Mr. Sherman, as I
have but a varra moderate capacity for the delivery o’
written words.”</p>

<p>At this juncture, Adam, the steward, rang the
breakfast-bell, and the captain and Mr. Sherman went
below.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is scarcely any ceremony more impressive than
a burial at sea; perhaps because nowhere does man feel
his littleness more than when the mighty ocean surrounds
him. The graves of the dead on shore in a measure
localise their inmates, and our associations are fortified
by the power of referring to the departed as beings who
slumber in green places, and are at all seasons visitable.</p>

<p>But a burial at sea is the launching of the dead into
infinity. The sense of his extinction is absolute. He is
swallowed up and annihilated by the universe of water,
which also seems to overwhelm his very memory.</p>

<p>At twelve o’clock the body of Johnson, sewn up in
canvas, with a weight of lead attached to his feet, lay
extended upon one of the gratings of the main-hatchway,
one end resting on the bulwarks of the ship, the other
upon the shoulders of two sailors. The crew stood round,
holding their caps in their hands; and near the body
stood Mr. Sherman reading the Burial Service. The
mournful and impressive spectacle was greatly heightened
by the tolling of the bell on the quarter-deck, which
mingled its clear chimes with the words delivered by
Mr. Sherman. The vessel was sailing on an even keel,
her white sails swelling and soaring one above another,
and forming a lovely picture against the bright blue sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
The water leaped and sparkled and frothed against her
clean sides, and those swallows of the deep, the stormy
petrels, chased her flashing wake, and gave by their
presence a finishing detail to the whole of the sun-lighted
scene.</p>

<p>How unutterable the mystery hedging the motionless
figure in the canvas shroud&mdash;his name unknown, a waif
of dead humanity snatched for a brief moment from the
imperious deep, whose will it was to keep him! The
seamen sent shrinking glances at the bundle on the
grating. That he had suffered; that famine had made
a skeleton of him; that thirst had twisted his lean face
into an expression of agony which death was powerless
to smooth out, was all they knew.</p>

<p>“<i>We therefore commit his body to the deep, to be turned
into corruption</i>&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The captain motioned with his hand; the grating
was tilted, and its burden went like a flash from the
bulwarks; the steersman turned his face upon his
shoulder, hearing the hollow plunge; but those on the
main-deck stood without a move among them, listening
to the final, comfortable, glorious <span class="lock">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<i>Looking for the resurrection of the body (when the sea
shall give up her dead), and the life of the world to come,
through our Lord Jesus Christ, who at His coming shall
change our vile body, that it may be like His glorious body,
according to the mighty working whereby He is able to subdue
all things to Himself.</i>”</p>

<p>The reader closed the book; the grating was restored
to its place; and the men in twos and threes moved
slowly forward, talking in subdued tones; and for the
remainder of that day at least no sound of loose laughter
or reckless words was to be heard in the forecastle.</p>

</div>


<p>Holdsworth regained his strength slowly, and on the
fourth day Mr. Sherman, who attended him with the
gentle and unobtrusive solicitude of a perfectly benevolent
mind, suggested that a visit on deck might
freshen him up and contribute to his recovery.</p>

<p>To this Holdsworth had been looking forward with
indescribable eagerness, believing that the sight of the
boat of which Mr. Sherman had spoken would recall his
memory. His mind, indeed, presented a phenomenon.
He remembered nothing&mdash;literally <i>nothing</i>. His actual
life, as he was then living it, practically dated from the
moment of the return of his consciousness. All that
had gone before was pitch darkness. That the faculty
of memory was not <i>dead</i>, was proved by his capacity to
remember his thoughts and feelings, the offices and faces
of those who waited on him, the food he had eaten, the
names of those he conversed with, during the time he
had been in the cabin of the barque. But behind this
was impenetrable gloom, every glance at which tortured
him, so inexplicable was his helplessness to penetrate it.</p>

<p>The mind of an infant has been likened to a sheet
of blank paper; we may extend the image in Holdsworth’s
case by conceiving that all the characters which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
experience had written upon his mind had been effaced,
and that, what new characters there were upon it, were
the impressions only which he had received since he
had been awakened from the deadly stupor that had
conquered him a few hours before his rescue.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman was fully persuaded that Holdsworth’s
memory would return with his strength; and had
therefore foreborne from making any experiments by
questions or allusions until the time should come when
the renewal of health would enable the sufferer to sustain
the fatigue of thought. He was impressed and
touched by the poor fellow’s docility, his sweetness of
temper, and his gratitude, which moved him to tears as
often as he attempted to express it. But no clue was
to be obtained from his conversation as to the profession
he had followed. There was not a shoppish expletive
in his language. He named things after the established
prescription of Johnson’s Dictionary, and might as well
have been a clerk, a dentist, a builder, a Member of
Parliament, or even an attorney, as a sailor.</p>

<p>The “Jessie Maxwell” was now in the hot latitudes.
The fourth day was lovely, with a north-east breeze on
the port quarter, and a burning sun, from which an
awning protected the deck. An easy chair was placed
near the skylight for Holdsworth, who gained the deck,
leaning on Mr. Sherman’s arm. He halted on the last
step of the companion-ladder, and clung to his friend
with a look of mingled surprise and fear in his face.</p>

<p>Had there been any one, among those who watched
him with curiosity, who had known him as the chief
mate of the “Meteor,” he could scarcely have contemplated
this wreck of a man without deep emotion.
Conceive, if you can, a face with every characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
that had once contributed to give it manly beauty,
wrung out of it by sufferings which had left ineffaceable
marks on every inch of the whole surface of the countenance.
Conceive a stooped and trembling figure, the
shoulders forward so as to hollow the chest, and the
back bowed like an old man’s, the arms lengthened by
the abnormal attitude and defeating every faint suggestion
of symmetry which the eye might still hope to find.
But this expresses nothing of the real transformation
that had been wrought; of that subtle modification of
expression, of the spiritual conditions of the face, of
changes achieved by the most delicate strokes, but
which were as effectual as a recasting of the whole figure
and countenance could have been. He was dressed
partly in his own clothes, partly in some of the clothes
belonging to the second mate, who was a slight man,
but whose garments hung loosely on Holdsworth. He
wore his own coat, which formerly had buttoned tight
across his chest, and which his muscular arms had filled
out, as the fingers a glove; and he could now have
buttoned it nearly twice around him. The ring that
he had worn on his left hand had slipped from his
skeleton finger long ago, when he had been splashing
the sea-water over his face in vain endeavour to quench
the burning agony in his head and throat. He might
have worn Dolly’s wedding-ring on his middle finger
now, for his hands were indeed scarcely more than bone.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman eyed him anxiously as he stood tottering
at the companion-hatchway. It seemed as if the
long-desired revelation had come to the suffering man,
and that he could now remember.</p>

<p>“Look about you,” he said, “and tell me if there is
anything you see that recalls old impressions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see nothing that does this,” replied Holdsworth in
a low voice. “Where is the boat I was taken from?”</p>

<p>“On the main-deck yonder.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see her,” said Holdsworth eagerly.
“<i>One</i> idea may light up all.”</p>

<p>They walked slowly forward. Here and there a
seaman repairing a sail, or working in the lower shrouds,
or doing one of the endless jobs of splicing, whipping,
tarring, cleaning, which are so many conditions of the
maritime life, looked at Holdsworth earnestly, but never
intrusively; and when he was at the boat some of the
hands came up to him with a spokesman, a middle-aged
sailor in ear-rings, who said:</p>

<p>“Beg pardon, sir, but all hands wishes to say as
they’re werry glad to see you up and doing; and if
there’s e’er a thing any man among us can do in helping
to make you comfortable while you’re with us, they’ll
do it and welcome; and no liberty is intended.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, and God bless you!” answered Holdsworth,
greatly moved by this speech, and with an
expression on his face that could hardly fail to let the
honest seamen know that their goodwill was not the
less appreciated because it provoked no lengthened
reply. The men retired, saying among themselves that,
“though the gentleman warn’t a sailor, he ought to be
one; and though he was nothing but a skeleting, he
had as honest a face on him as ever they seed.”</p>

<p>“This is the boat,” said Mr. Sherman.</p>

<p>Holdsworth steadied himself by holding on to the
gunwale and looked into it. The bags of bread lay
under the aftermost thwart; there was the open locker
which the sea had filled with water; there were the
empty kegs, whose hollow rollings, as the boat had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
swayed to and fro, had formed such suggestive notes of
torture, as one might think would nevermore depart
from the ear that had received the echo. If there were
impressions like red-hot brands to sear the mind with
burning transcripts of the ugly agonising facts they
counterfeited, one, if any of them, would surely be the
impression conveyed by the scenes of which the interior
of the boat had been the theatre. Here the widow had
died, with her arm hanging over the side, yonder the
General had expired, pointing to the phantom of his
native town, which dying memory had evoked from
the air; from that spot the actor had leaped; and on
that seat the boy had died, holding out his hands to
the sinking sun. The little arena should have been
vital with memory, so small was the space in which
infinite human misery had been packed. But to Holdsworth
it conveyed no ideas. Not the faintest illumination
entered his face in surveying it. To Mr. Sherman
it was a thousandfold more significant than to Holdsworth,
who was the chief actor in the heart-breaking
tragedy that had been enacted in it. Yet he knew that
it <i>ought</i> to have an interest for him; and he stood
clutching and staring at it, with a frowning forehead,
wrestling wildly with his mind, in which the corpse of
memory lay deep and hidden.</p>

<p>After a long interval he passed his hand across his
eyes, and turned to Mr. Sherman.</p>

<p>“It will not come,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman was both disappointed and astonished;
disappointed by the fruitless result of an inspection, the
good effect of which he had counted upon, and astonished
by this phenomenon of the utter extinction of the most
life-giving faculty of the mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew him to the boat again, and said:</p>

<p>“See now; you were found there, lying under that
seat, and beside the mast lay another man, a dark-faced
man, dressed in sailor’s clothes. Do you remember?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Look at those bags of biscuit. They were found
soaking in the locker. Those bags contained all the food
you had on board. You must have suffered horribly
from the dread of starvation when you found the biscuit
spoilt by the salt water. Recall your thoughts on
making the discovery. Can you?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Holdsworth, pressing his hand to his
head.</p>

<p>“There was a black flag&mdash;a piece of stuff, a portion
of a woman’s dress it seemed&mdash;fastened to the mast-head.
Do you remember?”</p>

<p>Holdsworth said “No.”</p>

<p>“Had you a woman with you?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell.”</p>

<p>“See if you can go farther back. Try to recollect
where your ship sailed from. Was it England?”</p>

<p>“England? Yes&mdash;I know England&mdash;but I do not
remember if I came from England,” Holdsworth replied,
with profound anxiety in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Come! you remember England! Did you sail
from Liverpool?”</p>

<p>“I know Liverpool!” he exclaimed quickly.</p>

<p>“And London?”</p>

<p>“Yes! yes!”</p>

<p>“And what was the name of your ship?”</p>

<p>Holdsworth thought and thought without avail.</p>

<p>Herein was the deception that misled Mr. Sherman:
Holdsworth could perfectly remember familiar names,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
but they had to be pronounced in his hearing before he
could recall them. In like manner he could tell the
names and discourse of the things he beheld, <i>because he
saw them</i>. Had Johnson lived, he would have known
and called him Johnson. Had Mr. Sherman spoken of
Dolly, of Southbourne, of the London Docks, of the
“Meteor,” of any of the incidents connected with the
“Meteor’s” loss, Holdsworth would have remembered
exactly as much as he heard. But, in the absence of
suggestion, his memory was powerless&mdash;absolutely helpless&mdash;to
generate independent conclusions as to the impressions
his mind had received previous to his rescue.</p>

<p>The real miracle lay in <i>this</i> contradiction&mdash;in the
death of memory, dating <i>up to</i> the moment of the swoon
in the boat; in its resurrection to health and vigour,
dating <i>from</i> the moment of his recovery.</p>

<p>He returned to the chair that had been placed for him
near the skylight, and Mr. Sherman, still not despairing
of arousing this dormant faculty, went below and returned
with the parcel of things that had been taken
from Holdsworth’s pockets. These were given him one
by one, but he handled them without recognition.</p>

<p>“But you know their names?” said Mr. Sherman.</p>

<p>“Yes. This is a knife. This is a watch.”</p>

<p>“They are yours; found in your pockets.”</p>

<p>His hand trembled, and he gazed at them with
devouring eyes; but no other idea was conveyed to
him by Mr. Sherman’s assurance than the bare fact that
they were his property. He could not remember having
purchased or owned them.</p>

<p>“It’s only a question of time, my man,” said Captain
Duff, who stood by looking on at these strange
ineffectual experiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>No mere effort of imagination can do justice to
Holdsworth’s suffering. The feeling that he <i>ought</i> to
remember, coupled with his incapacity and the sense of
the past holding, perhaps, memories of vital consequence
to him to recall, created a mental torture more afflicting
than it is in the power of any man, who has not suffered
in this way, to conceive. Loss of memory, even in
trifling matters, always partakes of the nature of pain.
The fruitless effort to recall a name, a date, begets uneasiness,
and is soon converted into a positive torment.
But figure your mind haunted with a sense of the significance
of the past, not one faintest glimpse of which it
is permitted to you to obtain. Figure yourself groping
in a dense gloom, saying: “There are things here
which I <i>feel</i> are precious to me, which are of deep consequence
to my happiness and to the happiness of others,
but I cannot recall their names or their aspect!” and
meanwhile the subtlest of your instincts is driving you
mad with importunities to prosecute your search and
lay the store of memory open to the light! This is
worse than blindness; it is death in life. The years
that you have lived are cut away from your existence,
and with them all the precious accumulations of experience&mdash;love,
sorrow, and thought itself. God preserve
us all from such an affliction!</p>

<span class="smaller">SAILORS’ SYMPATHY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The “Jessie Maxwell” was bound for Sydney, New
South Wales, freighted with what is called a general
cargo&mdash;pianos, nails, scents, and such matters. She
carried only one passenger, Mr. Sherman, whose cabin
was given him as a favour by Captain Duff, who partly
owned the barque, and who had a great friendship for
the gentleman, whose house he visited in Sydney. Mr.
Sherman was a merchant, doing business in wool, tallow,
and other Australian exports, and had been visiting
London and Glasgow for agents and consignees, and
also to benefit his health by a sea voyage. He was one
of the most humane men in the colony, very well to do,
but prosperous by his own efforts. He had a commanding
figure, a large, mild, intellectual eye, and the kindliest
smile that ever graced the human face. The
strong benevolence of his character made his manner
singularly fascinating; and before Holdsworth had
known him a fortnight, he was bound to him by a feeling
of affection, which, though it might have owed
something of its depth to gratitude, must have existed
in a complete form, without reference to the great kindness
that had been shown him.</p>

<p>The days passed quickly. In the equatorial latitudes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the barque was becalmed for two days; and then a gale
rose, and drove her into the south-east trade-winds.</p>

<p>If Mr. Sherman and Captain Duff had ever felt disposed
to believe that Holdsworth might have been a
sailor, they considered that probability entirely disposed
of by his behaviour on the first day of the gale.</p>

<p>He was on deck when the wind was freshening,
walking to and fro with Mr. Sherman, whose arm he
could now do without, having recovered as much of his
strength as it seemed likely he would ever get back.
The wind came up in a sudden squall, and took the
barque on the starboard beam. Her royals were set,
but the yards fortunately were trimmed to receive the
breeze. The vessel heeled over under the great weight
of canvas, and there was some hurry amongst the men
as they let go the royal and topgallant halliards, though
there was nothing in the confusion to occasion the least
alarm, even in a passenger who had been a month at
sea. But the effect of the squall upon Holdsworth was
extraordinary. As the vessel lay over, he grasped Mr.
Sherman’s arm with looks of terror in his face, and ran
to windward, flinging fearful glances at the sea on the
lee side. Mr. Sherman offered to help him to go below,
but he declined to leave the deck, and clung to the
weather mizzen rigging, apparently speechless with
alarm.</p>

<p>As it came on to blow heavily, the men reefed the
topsails; and Holdsworth literally trembled as the
yards rushed down upon the caps, and the canvas
thundered as the helmsman luffed to enable the hands
to pick up the sails more easily.</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” exclaimed Mr. Sherman soothingly,
“you must endeavour to control yourself. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
is no danger, indeed. This uproar will cease presently.
We encountered much worse weather than this in the
North Atlantic, shortly after leaving Glasgow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am ashamed of my weakness; my nerves
are gone,” answered the poor fellow. And then, seeing
the men tumbling up aloft and laying out upon the
yards, he covered his face with his hands, saying he
dared not look, lest he should see them fall.</p>

<p>The ship was made snug presently; but the sea rose,
and now and again a shower of spray came flying over
the forecastle and the main-deck, which so violently
agitated Holdsworth that he let go the rigging and
made for the companion. He walked like a paralysed
man: his hands outstretched, and his head turning
about on his shoulders. He gained his cabin and laid
himself down in his bunk, exquisitely alive to his
pusillanimity, and weeping over his incapacity to control
himself.</p>

<p>The skipper went up to Mr. Sherman.</p>

<p>“Our friend is no sailor. I think you can tell <i>that</i>,
Mr. Sherman?”</p>

<p>“No; that is proved. The instincts of his old life,
had he been a sailor, would have kept up his courage
without respect of his memory. But let us bear in mind
that his nervousness is the result of the terrible experience
he has gone through. If illness&mdash;if fever, for instance&mdash;will
rob us of our nerves, how much more the
unspeakable agony of hunger and thirst, and the deadly,
hopeless captivity and exposure in an open boat for
days, and maybe for weeks! It would drive me
mad!”</p>

<p>“Ay, that is verra true. Understand me, I am not
speaking disrespectfully of the puir soul. I would only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
bid you obsairve by his fear that he canna hae been a
tarry-breeks. The auld speerit would live in spite o’
his nerves, and would have risen to the cries of the men
and the bocking o’ the water. That’s my opeenion.”</p>

<p>Thus we may learn how some opinions, delivered in
sound earnest, are manufactured.</p>

<p>Not a tarry-breeks!</p>

<p>There had never sailed out of any port in Christendom
a finer, a more courageous sailor than Holdsworth.
What would Captain Duff have thought of his “opeenion,”
had he been told that that same halting, crippled
figure, who had hastened to his cabin with movements
full of fear, had been, only a month before, an
upright, handsome man, with an eye full of light and
spirit, with nerves and skill equal to occasions which
would have overwhelmed the honest Scotch skipper and
left him nowhere, with a heart as gentle as a maiden’s
and manly as Nelson’s; always foremost in the moment
of danger, with the voice of a trumpet to deliver unerring
commands; a leader in measures of which the peril
made the stoutest-hearted tremble and stand still;
scaling the dizzy heights of whirling masts and spars,
to whose summits he might have beckoned in vain to
those very seamen of the “Jessie Maxwell,” whose
movements, now in the weakness of his crushed and
broken life, he dared not even watch?</p>

<p>Of all sights, that of the strong and lion-hearted
man, smitten down by sickness, by misery, by misfortune
to the feebleness of an infant, to the timidity of a
girl, is surely the most affecting. Such a man I have
seen&mdash;a sailor&mdash;entering the forecastle full of the courage
that makes heroes of men, and leaving it, after two
months of confinement, with nerves and health so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
shattered, that he has not dared to approach the bulwarks
of the ship for fear of falling overboard!</p>

<p>Give the full measure of your pity, kind reader, to
such as these. There is no form of human suffering
whose pathos is more unqualified.</p>

<p>So Mr. Sherman, agreeing with Captain Duff, was
confident that, whatever else Holdsworth might have
been, he was not a sailor. This was, at all events, a
negative discovery, which lopped off one of the numerous
conjectures with which the mystery of Holdsworth’s
past was considered. Strange it was to talk to the
poor fellow, to hear his rational language, his discussions,
his sensible remarks, and to feel that he was
speaking, so to say, on this side of a curtain, behind
which were hidden all the true interests of his life.
Once or twice he staggered Captain Duff by a nautical
question, the very nature of which implied an intimate
acquaintance with the sea; but his unaffected timidity
when the vessel rolled, or when the weather was squally,
always drove the skipper back upon his first conclusion,
and made him think that the knowledge of sails, ropes,
yards, etc., which Holdsworth displayed, had been picked
up by him as a passenger, or even out of books.</p>

<p>However, his marine allusions were few and far
between. His horror of the sea was remarkable, and
he repeatedly inquired how long it would be before
they reached Sydney. Moreover, he was rendered
taciturn by his ceaseless struggles with memory; and
would pass whole hours lost in thought, during which,
it was observed, no gleam ever entered his face to indicate
his recurrence to any action, phase, or condition
of his past.</p>

<p>Often, when the main-deck was clear, he would steal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
to the boat and stand contemplating her with his hands
locked, and his brow corrugated with anxious thought.
It was strange to see him running his eyes over her,
handling the yoke-lines, peering into the locker, and
literally groping for an inspiration.</p>

<p>Once, the boatswain of the vessel, a shrewd English
seaman, who, as well as every other soul on board the
barque, knew of Holdsworth’s total loss of memory, seeing
him alone staring at the boat, came out of his
berth, and addressed him:</p>

<p>“They say, sir, that you don’t remember this boat?”</p>

<p>“I am trying to recollect,” answered Holdsworth,
looking at him with the expression of painful eagerness
that was now almost a characteristic of his face.</p>

<p>“See here, sir, when that there boat was sighted,
there was only two persons found aboard of her. You
was one, and the other was the poor fellow we buried.
Now, what I’m always saying to my mates is this: this
here’s a ship’s quarter-boat, and more hands went in
her than two when she put off. Now, sir, try and think
how many there was.”</p>

<p>“I remember nothing. I would to God I could!”</p>

<p>“But don’t you reck’let what your thoughts was
when the bread got soaked with the salt water?”</p>

<p>Holdsworth shook his head.</p>

<p>“Here,” continued the good-natured boatswain,
“might be the bread,” pointing to the locker. “Here,”
he went on, pointing to the stern-sheets, “might you be
sitting, steering of her; when up comes a sea and washes
over you or the chap that has the yokes. Now, may
be, you notices this, but can only groan, having to keep
her head well before it&mdash;putting you for the man as
steers. But you can think, for all that; and it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
ha’ scared the blood out of you to guess that the little
food that remained was all spoilt. Can’t you remember?”</p>

<p>Holdsworth, who had followed every syllable with
trembling anxiety, shook his head again.</p>

<p>“Many things have happened; something tells me
that,” he answered; “but I can remember nothing.”</p>

<p>“Would you like to step into the foks’le, sir? Perhaps
you might see something there as will help you,”
said the boatswain, who was moved by Holdsworth’s
hopeless reply.</p>

<p>They descended through the fore-scuttle into the dim
semicircular abode, with huge beams across the upper
deck, from which depended a number of hammocks, and
bunks all around, with their edges chipped and hacked
by the men, who used them for cutting tobacco upon;
and on the deck, sea-chests and bundles, and pannikins
and tin dishes scattered everywhere. The gloom was
scarcely irradiated by a couple of lamps resembling teapots
with wicks in their spouts; and the faces of the
men glimmered over the sides of the hammocks or in
the darkness of the bunks. Up in a corner was a
group of men, consisting of a portion of the watch on
deck, assembled around two sea-chests, on which were
seated a couple of ordinary seamen, fastened down by
nails driven through the seat of their breeches into the
lids of the chests. Their sleeves were tucked above the
muscles of their arms, and they were deciding, by means
of their fists, an argument which had been commenced
half an hour before in the main-top. Being nailed very
nearly at arm’s length from each other, their efforts
to deal each other blows threw them into contortions
irresistibly ridiculous; but the lookers-on, having probably
no very lively sense of the absurd, stood around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
with grave faces, thoughtfully chewing tobacco, and
now and then offering the combatants a friendly suggestion
where best to hit each other. Some men lay in
hammocks directly over the heads of the pugilists, but
took no further interest in the proceedings going on
under their beds, than now and again to pop a burnt
and hairy face over the edge of the tight canvas, and in
polite and genteel terms recommend the youngsters not
to make too much noise if they didn’t want to be nailed
fore and aft upon the lids of the chests like bats.</p>

<p>“Now, sir,” said the boatswain, advancing a few
steps into the forecastle, but not even deigning to notice,
much less offering to interfere, between the combatants,
“see if there ain’t nothing here to give you an idea.”</p>

<p>There should have been many things; for the forecastle
of a ship was as familiar to Holdsworth as any
part of her; and though, when he had first gone to sea,
he had slept in a cabin near his father’s, he had spent
the greater part of his time forward among the men,
taking instructions from them in all kinds of seafaring
work, and never more happy than when squatting on a
chest, plying a marlin spike, and listening to the yarns
of the sailors around him.</p>

<p>The boatswain watched him with looks of interest,
which faded into disappointment.</p>

<p>“Is there nothing?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” said Holdsworth gazing blankly around
him.</p>

<p>“But you know those things are called hammocks?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can tell you the names of everything that I
see, but that don’t help me.”</p>

<p>“Well I <i>am</i> blowed!” muttered the boatswain,
under his breath; whereupon Holdsworth, thanking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
him for the trouble he had taken, withdrew, pained by
the glances and whispers of the men, and rendered
nervous and dispirited by the smells, the fight in the
corner, and the strong movement of the ship, felt here
more than anywhere else.</p>

<span class="smaller">A PRESENTATION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Not knowing how to address or speak to Holdsworth,
the skipper and Mr. Sherman and the others called him
Mr. H., that letter being all they knew of his name.</p>

<p>He was treated by captain and officers with great
kindness, shared their table, and was even furnished by
them with clothes, of which, you may conceive, he stood
very much in need.</p>

<p>None of them could doubt that he had friends, that
he held a position, that he might have money; and
they waited day after day for the return of his memory,
which was to solve the mystery his silence wrought, and
set him square with the world again. Indeed, his utter
incapacity to recall the smallest incident connected with
his past, was almost provoking, despite its pathos.
Captain Duff wanted to know the name of the vessel
that had been wrecked, the port she hailed from, the
port she had been bound to, her cargo, who her captain
was. How astounding to this healthy little man that
such plain and easy questions should provoke no replies.
Perhaps, had he been kept without food and water for
six or seven days, subjected to a long series of appalling
mental tortures, exposed on the sea in an open boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
that was scarcely visible a mile off, with Death the
skeleton for a helmsman, he might have moderated his
wonderment&mdash;nay, even admitted that such experiences
were not only highly calculated to deprive a man of his
memory, but to drive him raving mad for the remainder
of his life.</p>

<p>But the barque was drawing near her journey’s end,
in long. 120°. The pale outline of Van Diemen’s
land must heave in sight shortly away on the port
bow.</p>

<p>They were now in the beginning of November, and
had been seventy-two days from Glasgow. One bright
morning Holdsworth was seated on the skylight, with
his eyes on a book that had been lent him, but with
his mind groping, as it more or less always was, in
the darkness that hid the past from his sight. There
was a blind man’s look on his face when he was thus
thinking, that was more conclusive of the ghastly
sincerity of his intellectual bereavement than anything
that could be said or done. You saw by the blank
expression in his eyes that his gaze was turned inwards,
and by his general air that the search he was making
was a fruitless one.</p>

<p>He had been taken out of the boat a ghost&mdash;a gray
skeleton; he had picked up a little since that time, but
his present aspect was merely a slight improvement on
the forlorn image he had presented when rescued. The
familiar picture of a broad-shouldered, hearty, vigorous,
handsome young man, smooth-cheeked, clear-eyed, was
gone; in its place was a wasted shadow, a drooping,
hesitating figure, with a characterisation of deformity
in its movements, though there was no positive deformity;
thin, feeble hands whitened by sickness, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
pale face hollowed in the eyes, and made ragged with a
growth of black beard and moustache.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>



<p>The change was altogether too remarkable to have
been effected by physical suffering only; the heart had
worked the deeper transformation&mdash;the soft, tender,
womanly heart brought face to face with sufferings it
was constrained to contemplate, to hearken to murmurs
of agony it could not soothe nor silence. Consider, I
pray you consider, that he had beheld five shocking
deaths, each one accompanied by circumstances of unspeakable
horror or misery. Stretched over a longer
space of time, they might, by giving his heart breathing-spaces
between, have inured it to the inevitable scenes;
but crowding upon him one after the other in quick
succession, they ground his sensibility to dust, and
though he had now no memory whereby to renew the
sufferings of these ten days, its blighting effect was not
the less clearly visible in him, its operation had not
been the less complete.</p>

<p>Whilst he thus sate, as lonely now in a ship full of
men as ever he had been in the boat with Johnson
dying under the thwart, Mr. Sherman came on deck
and took a seat at his side. Holdsworth was so
engrossed that he did not perceive his companion, and
Mr. Sherman, unwilling to break in upon his thoughts,
remained silent, watching him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Holdsworth turned; the blank dead look
went out of his eyes, and he smiled.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“So memory still defies you?” said Mr. Sherman
kindly, and with just as much anxiety as would let
his companion understand the sincerity of the interest
taken in him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Holdsworth, the smile fading off
his face. “Once&mdash;once only, just now, a fancy came
into my mind&mdash;I cannot explain its nature, or what it
betokened, but it vanished the instant I attempted to
grapple with it.”</p>

<p>“Did it leave no impression&mdash;no idea whatever?”</p>

<p>“None. I can compare it to nothing better than a
dim light stealing across the wall of a dark room and
disappearing.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman was silent; and presently said:</p>

<p>“What do you propose to do when you reach
Sydney?”</p>

<p>“I have often thought of that. I must seek work
and wait.”</p>

<p>“Wait until your memory returns?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“The captain and I were talking about you just
now, and I suggested that, were you to return to
England, which I am persuaded is your native country,
you might come across a friend who would give you
your memory back at once; or failing such a friend,
you might encounter some scene which would achieve
the same end.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I could bear another long voyage
just yet,” answered Holdsworth, glancing at the sea.
“What should make the water so hateful to me?
Sometimes I fancy I must have passed many years upon
it, and that it has served me badly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, your dislike is easily understood. But now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
with regard to your prospects. Will it be wise for you
to remain in Australia? You must have friends at
home&mdash;supposing England to be your home.”</p>

<p>“But how shall I find them?”</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s it. Much might be done if I could only
discover your name. I must make a list of all the
names beginning with H. The only question is, would
you know your name if you were to see it?”</p>

<p>“I would try,” answered the poor fellow humbly.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I’ll tell you what I have in my mind,”
said Mr. Sherman, laying his hand kindly on Holdsworth’s.
“I look upon you as a man whom, having
brought to life&mdash;for I take the credit of your recovery
to myself&mdash;it is my proper privilege to support. But
I shall not allow you to be dependent on charity. I
have an office in Sydney, and you shall have a desk in
that office, and so earn a salary that will maintain you
in comfort. By-and-by your memory will come back.
You will then return to England, and I shall heartily
wish you God’s blessing, for you have suffered&mdash;yes,
you have suffered very much&mdash;more than I, more than
any of us, can conceive.”</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, his voice faltering.</p>

<p>Holdsworth seized his hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sherman ... good, kind friend ... God
will reward you ... I have suffered ... I ... I
feel it here,” pressing his hand to his head. “Sir, dear
sir, believe me grateful!”</p>

<p>“I do believe you grateful, and it pleases me to
believe it, for it is a pleasure to serve the grateful.
Well, we have settled that. But understand, though
you will remain with me as long as you like, yet, at the
first prompting of your memory, I shall exhort you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
return to England, for I cannot persuade myself that
you are not leaving relatives and friends who will
mourn you as dead, and suffer unnecessary sorrow on
your account.”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes! I think this sometimes!” cried Holdsworth
passionately. “<i>That</i> is the haunting thought&mdash;but
it may not be! Oh, sir, it <i>cannot</i> be! Were there
dear ones belonging to me, <i>could</i> my memory forget
them? Could they be <i>very</i> dear to me, and be forgotten?”</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman drew a deep breath, and said, “No, I
believe that would be impossible. If love united you
to any person at your home, that love would be an
instinct to prompt you with an influence that should
have no reference to memory. But the mind of man is
a great mystery.”</p>

<p>There was a short silence, and then Mr. Sherman
asked: “Do you ever dream?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“But you may dream, though your mind cannot retain
the impression of its dreams. Could you awaken
from a dream of home, your darkness might be made
light.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of that,” answered Holdsworth,
with the air of a man who, having exhausted speculation,
can find no inspiration in any kind of suggestion.</p>

<p>“And you have no inclination to return to England?”</p>

<p>“It cannot matter where I am whilst my memory
remains dead. England! You speak a familiar word,
and I know it is a country, but I cannot bend my mind
back to it. It gives me no ideas. I stretch my thoughts
over the great waste of waters we have traversed in this
ship, and find nothing more than sea and sky&mdash;sea and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
sky! I can find no country lying beyond&mdash;nothing to
give me thoughts of home. Oh, sir!” he cried, “you
cannot understand this! How should you? It is
horrible for me to look back and see the whole of my
life eclipsed&mdash;to see a wall of darkness reared close
behind me through which I <i>cannot</i> see! What things
precious, infinitely precious to me, may be hidden! It
would ease me, sir, greatly ease me, if God would but
illuminate my mind only for a moment, that I might
know what is lost to me. And the loneliness of it all!&mdash;the
feeling of desolation that comes over me in my
solitude! Mr. Sherman, consider how lonely I am!
Not a voice, not an echo of anything that may be dear
to me, comes out of that darkness behind me. Who
would believe that memory is life, and the loss of it
worse than death?”</p>

<p>He bowed his head and covered his face with his
thin hands, and some tears trickled through his fingers.</p>

<p>God help him! Suffering had subdued that manly
nature to the feebleness and weakness of a child, and
tears, though there had been a time when no anguish
of his own could have wrung such things from his eyes,
now easily rose with the expression of his feelings.</p>

<p>Here Captain Duff, coming up to Mr. Sherman, interrupted
the conversation, and Holdsworth, ashamed
of the weakness he had no power to control, went with
his slow step and shaky movements below.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When they were within two days’ sail of Sydney,
the boatswain and two hands came aft to the skipper,
and the boatswain, touching his cap, spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“Sir, the ship’s crew have asked me to turn-to and
say this here for them: that they werry well know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
that the gentleman who has lost his memory hasn’t any
clothes, and, maybe, no money; and as shipwreck’s a
thing that may happen to any of us, and as the poor
gentleman’s suffered more nor he’s allowed to remember,
though, as my mate Bill here says, it ain’t werry hard
to guess what he’s gone through, as there are some of
the men for’ard who have bin short of water in their
time, and spin ’arrowing yarns such as I never heerd
the like on; why, what I was a sayin’ was this: that
the ship’s company, barrin’ one, which is an Isle o’
Dorg’s man&mdash;but <i>he’ll</i> come over&mdash;want’s to make up a
purse o’ money for the poor gentleman, and though
some o’ them ain’t got much to give, leastways to spare,
they’ll all lend a hand, and only wait to hear if you and
the mates’ll start the list, which ’ud be more ship-shape.”</p>

<p>The boatswain delivered this speech with great
hesitation&mdash;not from nervousness, but from a perception
of the puzzling nature of words, which had a trick of
falling athwartships along the course of his meaning,
and bringing him up with a round turn. Having concluded,
he glanced at his mates to see if they approved,
on which they nodded a good deal of hair over their
eyes, and then wiped their mouths with their wrists.</p>

<p>“Right you are,” said the skipper, addressing them
with his eyes fixed on the main-topsail, and his hand
out to motion the man at the wheel to keep her steady.
“You can put me down for five pounds, and Mr. Banks
and Mr. Anderson for a sovereign apiece. If they don’t
fork out, I’ll pay for them. Steady, I say, steady!
Dom it, man, you’re a point off your course!”</p>

<p>That evening, the weather being mild and balmy,
and a glorious breeze right astern of the barque, Holds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>worth
was seated aft when the skipper came up to him
and said:</p>

<p>“The ship’s company have been making you up a
purse, sir, as a token of their sympathy with the
temporal losses you must have sustained by the wreck
of the vessel, which there canna be a doubt you were
on board of, and with the suffering you endured in the
boat. The bo’sun waits to know when it’ll be agreeable
to you to receive the gift.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;really&mdash;the poor fellows must keep their
money&mdash;I cannot accept it,” replied Holdsworth, greatly
agitated and moved.</p>

<p>“Oh, you must tak’ it, sir, or they’ll think you
<i>paughty</i>, as we say in Scotland. The bo’sun is waiting
at the capstan yonder, and the men are on tiptoe for’ard&mdash;look
at the heads louping in the fore-scuttle!”</p>

<p>Holdsworth left his chair and went slowly to the
boatswain. When the hands saw him draw near the
capstan, they wriggled out of the forecastle, out of the
galley, out from behind the long boat, and came slipping
aft, advancing and drawing back fitfully, and some on
tiptoe, to catch the speeches. A seaman somewhere
aloft came hand over fist down a backstay, finally landing
himself on the bulwarks, where he stood looking on.</p>

<p>The skipper, and Mr. Sherman, and the second mate
approached; and when the boatswain was going to
speak, the captain called:</p>

<p>“Draw closer, my lads. The gentleman can’t talk
to you out of earshot.”</p>

<p>The men, like shy schoolboys, elbowed each other
into a smaller semicircle, and stood staring and grinning
over one another’s shoulders.</p>

<p>“All ready, sir?” asked the boatswain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fire away!” answered the skipper.</p>

<p>The boatswain took off his hat and placed it on the
capstan; then drew from it a handkerchief of the size
of a union-jack, with which he dried his face and mouth;
he next fished in his coat pocket and produced a small
canvas bag, very neatly sewn. This he held in his
hand, and turned to Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“We don’t know your name, sir, and we’re werry
sorry that we don’t, ’cause there’s a great deal in a
name when you give a thing, ’specially to them as
has to speechify, and it helps ’em along like. (‘So
it dew, mate!’ from the crowd, and several heads
nodded emphatically.) I’m a seafarin’ man myself, and
come from Greenwich, and had no larnin’ taught me
when I was a boy, and so the present company will
please hexcuse bad grammar and the likes of that, seein’
that a seafarin’ man don’t want to know many words
besides those as consarn a ship. We’re all sailors here,
if the skipper will let me call him a sailor&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ma conscience! and what else am I?” cried the
skipper.</p>

<p>“Well, as I was a sayin’,” continued the boatswain,
looking discomfited for a moment, “we’re all sailors
here, barrin’ you, sir, and Mr. Sherman, and it’s only
men as go to sea as can know what an awful thing a
shipwreck is, and what a bad look-out thirst and hunger
is, and the feelings that overcome a man when he is in
a open boat miles away from the shore. We reckon that
you’ve passed through a deal o’ sufferin’, and being
sailors, it’s only right and proper that we should all of
us, from the skipper down, let you know by a better
sign than mere talk, which don’t go far, though it may
be werry comfortin’ sometimes, when you can under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>stand
what’s said to you&mdash;I say that we want to let
you know how sorry we are for you, and how werry
grateful we are that we belong to the wessel that picked
you up; and so, sir”&mdash;here he handed the bag to
Holdsworth&mdash;“all hands clubbed together to make up
this trifle o’ money jist to buy you a few things when
you get ashore; and I’m proud to say there ain’t a man
among us, though I <i>did</i> think one was goin’ to back out,
that hasn’t given something&mdash;&mdash;Beggin’ your parding
a moment; them scraps o’ paper in the purse are
horders wrote by me, and signed by the men as hasn’t
got ready money about ’em, for the captain to pay you
the valley in silver which they bear in figures; and
that money to be deducted from their wages. That’s
all, I think, sir,” he concluded, looking at the skipper.</p>

<p>A voice called out, “Three cheers for the gentleman!”
and forth burst a roar from the iron throats of
the men that made the decks ring again.</p>

<p>Holdsworth was unmanned, and looked downwards,
struggling with his emotion. But glancing up and
catching sight of the swarm of rough kindly faces
around him, he broke away, so to speak, from his
agitation, and answered as follows:</p>

<p>“If it had pleased God to leave me my memory, I
believe I could have done my gratitude more justice,
though I couldn’t have felt more grateful. For, sometimes,
when I have watched you at work, it has come
over me&mdash;not as a conviction&mdash;no! I wish it had; but
as a mere fancy only&mdash;that I too have been a sailor;
and if that be so, then I can understand why your
kindness does not overcome me with surprise, because I
ought to know that sailors’ hearts are the largest, the
truest, the most manly in the world, that there’s not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
sorrow their purses will not fly open to relieve, and that
a man, let him be what he will, is never so well recommended
to them as when he is poor and broken
down and friendless. I don’t know how properly to
thank you for your generous gift. (‘We don’t want
no thanks,’ said a voice; ‘if there’s enough to rig you
out and put some ’baccy in your pocket, that’s all we
want.’) Miserable, indeed, I shall be if my memory
plays me false in this&mdash;if it does not suffer me to carry
the recollection of your kindness to my death-bed. May
God bless you and guard you all back in safety to your
homes.”</p>

<p>He ceased, unable to say more.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Captain Duff, “we have done no more
than our duty in all this business from beginning to
end. In the name of all hands I return your good
wishes by praying that God may speedily give you back
your memory, and make you happy for the rest of your
days, as a proper compensation for what you have gone
through.”</p>

<p>He shook him by the hand, and then Mr. Anderson
stepped forward; then came the boatswain; and then
an able seaman; and then another able seaman; until
presently Holdsworth was engaged in shaking hands all
round, scarcely a man quitting the quarter-deck until a
grasp had been exchanged.</p>

<p>When all this hand-shaking was over, Captain Duff
ordered rum to be served out to the men, who then
returned to the forecastle with a sense of festivity upon
them, and passed the rest of the second dog-watch in
singing songs and dancing.</p>

<span class="smaller">SYDNEY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>At nine o’clock on the morning of the third day from
the time occupied in the last chapter, a hand stationed
on the look-out in the fore-top sent a roar from the
sky:</p>

<p>“Land right ahead!”</p>

<p>In half an hour’s time it was to be seen from the
deck, a mere blue vision stretching eel-shaped, upon the
horizon.</p>

<p>Australia! the great and wealthy continent of which
there were men then living whose fathers could recall
the time when this vast tract of land had no place in
the world’s knowledge of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Of all sensations, the first glimpse of the land
towards which a ship has been steering for weeks and
weeks, with seldom even so much as a passing sail to
relieve the monotony of the ocean, is the most thrilling.
The oldest seaman will desert his bunk or hammock to
make for the forecastle and have a look at the dim
cloud. The pale-faced steward, seldom seen on deck,
sneaks from his berth in the steerage redolent of lukewarm
soup and resonant with the ceaseless clattering of
crockery, to peer over the bulwarks at the far-off coast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
If there be passengers on board, you are sensible of an
uneasy movement among them, strangely suggestive of
mingled excitement and reluctance, as though they
were at once eager and loath to quit their floating
home, the familiar cabin in which so many hours have
been passed, the white decks which have become to
them what the pavement in front of your house is to
you. The ship is endeared to them, and the hold she
has upon them is felt now that they shall shortly leave
her. How nobly she has struggled with the waves
and the wind! What grandeur she assumes when
thought of with respect to the immense universe of
water she has traversed in safety! But a few weeks
ago, one might say, she was in English waters, and now
she is breasting the waves of the antipodes, raising her
graceful canvas to the heavens with almost conscious
elegance, as though exulting in the knowledge of the
feat she has performed&mdash;a feat of which no repetition
can ever diminish the wonder, the courage, and the
triumph.</p>

<p>And now the land loomed large and bold upon the
horizon, a gray and iron coast, inhospitable enough to
scare away all rash adventurers, one might think, in
search of new homes and brighter fortunes.</p>

<p>What was Captain Duff about! Did he mean to
run his ship bow on to those granite-coloured cliffs
stretching to right and left, with their swart base
marginated with a line of crawling foam? Screw your
eyes up attentively, and you will see two breaks in the
shore. The bowsprit of the “Jessie Maxwell” heads
for the break on the right. Slowly the coast grows
clearer. That break on the left is but a deceptive
hollow, with a vast block of rock lying in the blue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
shark-studded water, upon which, many years later,
a noble ship called the “Dunbar” shall be wrecked,
and, of a great crowd of human beings, but one man
saved.</p>

<p>And now behold the miracle of the seaman’s art!</p>

<p>For weeks and weeks, counting from the English
summer, the “Jessie Maxwell” has been surrounded by
the ocean, directed through light and darkness, through
bright sunshine and howling tempests charged with
sleet and spray, by no more than a little needle, but
gifted with a steadfastness of intelligence more unerring
than the loftiest that humanity is endowed with. For
weeks and weeks this little needle points and the
helmsman obeys, and onwards the ship sails through
hundreds of miles of water, until one morning those on
board awake and look ahead, and lo! there is the land,
with the ship’s head pointing accurately towards the
little cleft in the coast through which the great Bay of
Sydney is to be entered.</p>

<p>This bay is a vision of beauty. No hint of its
existence is given until you have sailed into it. The
effect produced by the contrast between the rugged,
iron, sterile coast beheld from the sea, and the loveliness
of deep blue water and summer islands richly wooded,
and green hills sloping to the water’s edge, and sandy
creeks, with the heavy bush to the right, and the
tropical splendour of vegetation that meets the eye
upon the outlying land&mdash;all which form the noble bay
into which you pass through the narrowest and most
repellent of headlands&mdash;is not to be described. One
might think that Nature had stooped to the human
device of a pantomimic surprise, and reared the bleak
Australian coast in this latitude for no other reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
than to give effect to the grand transformation scene
she exhibits behind it.</p>

<p>To the eyes of Holdsworth, wearied by the eternal
glancing or leaping of the sea, how sweet and refreshing
were the green shores, the houses peeping out here and
there upon the outskirts of the bush, the trees overhanging
the margin of the islands like living things
never weary of admiring their own shapes! Here and
there a boat rowed from shore to shore. Small coasters
lay at anchor, their sails clewed up but not furled, and
the men lounging drowsily aboard of them. Hark to
the humming of the locusts!&mdash;comparable to nothing
so much as the murmurs of a sleepy congregation
reciting the responses in church.</p>

<p>Anon the city of Sydney opened; at its foot a great
semicircular basin of water, with the masts of many
vessels standing out against the farther houses, and the
green hills backing all. How picturesque from a distance
the combined colours of the streaming flags, the
white-fronted houses, the green of the hills, and the
heavenly azure of the sky! All the way on the left
ran the houses into the country beyond, and close at
hand were shaggy abutments of wooded land, with
deep shady recesses through which the sunlight sparkled
on the emerald ground, with many boats upon the
water to give variety and life to the picture. Far, far
away, almost like an echo from the old world, the strains
of a band playing a hearty English melody could be
heard.</p>

<p>No thoughtful man can behold such a colony as this
without finding something at once pathetic and inspiring
in the spectacle. A great rugged continent, lying
hidden in the distant Pacific main, is encountered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
human enterprise; and in a few years we witness towns
and cities thronging its seaboard, and all along the surf-beaten
shores is heard the hum of industry. We mark
the inalienable love of home, of the mother-country, in
a thousand tokens, and find the measureless ocean
bridged by sympathy and memory, and Old England
renewed in such forms as make us scarcely conscious
of our distance from it; though sometimes thought itself,
when the thousand leagues of waters that flow
between are remembered, seems almost powerless to
present our beloved home to us as something real, so
vague, so dim, so inaccessibly remote has it become
since we left its shores. Signs of remembered things
are about us. We think of the home love which gave
that name to that street; which reared yonder house
in the likeness of one in the far-off land, that enshrines
the emigrant’s most precious memories of childhood;
which parcelled out yonder garden in the fashion of the
little tract of land in the distant country, whose soil is
sacred to the mind as the favoured retreat of a beloved
parent. The very nomenclature by which the colonist
dignifies some mean spot or small building by the name
of a noble city or a spacious edifice in the old home, is
full of pathos, since it can signify no more than a deep-rooted
affection (not to be weakened nor divorced by
the harshest recollection of the impracticable struggle for
bread which drove whole families across the sea) for
England, and a tender impulse to give permanent form
to memories which survive through many generations,
and create loyalty and patriotism among a people who
owe nothing to the country and the sovereign whom
they reverence, and would at any moment serve.
British faces are around us; British accents sound in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
our ears; and on all sides we behold signs of that
British courage, audacity, and genius, which grow
sublime under our gathering appreciation of the difficulties
which have been conquered and the triumphs
which have been achieved.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOMEWARD BOUND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the year 1832, within a week or two of the date
that would make the time exactly five years since the
“Meteor” lay off Gravesend, waiting to embark her
captain and start for the port it was her doom never to
reach, a large ship was sailing slowly up the river, her
poop crowded with passengers, and many heads ranged
along her bulwarks.</p>

<p>Far away aft, hard by the wheel, stood a man thickly
bearded, dressed in dark clothes, his arms folded, and
his eyes bent steadfastly upon the passing shore. He
was alone; for the rest of the passengers, of whom
there were many, were grouped about the break of the
poop talking to one another excitedly, or pointing to
the houses ashore, or watching the steerage passengers
on the main-deck cording their boxes, cramming their
clothes into bundles, and making preparations for landing
that afternoon.</p>

<p>There was something in the expression of this man’s
face which would have attracted and detained your
attention; a mixture of profound melancholy and
struggling surprise, clouded with what might have
passed very well for a mood of deep abstraction. His
features were thin and haggard, the nose pinched and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
white, his eyes dark and gleaming, and sunk in hollows,
shagged by eyebrows of black hair mingled with white,
which met in a perpendicular seam in his forehead. He
presented the appearance of one suffering from some
incurable constitutional malady which had wasted the
flesh off his bones, arched his back, hollowed his chest,
and brought into his face a permanent expression of
mingled pensiveness and sorrow.</p>

<p>A round-faced, brisk, and busy-looking little man
happening just then to pop his person out through the
companion, stood looking awhile at the shore with
eager twinkling eyes, and then, directing his gaze aft,
caught sight of our lonely individual and approached
him.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Hampden! there you are! still puzzling,
puzzling, eh?” he exclaimed in a hearty manner.
“Come now, you have seen Folkestone, Margate, the
Reculvers, eh, now? Confess that those places have
helped you to remember all you want to know.”</p>

<p>The person addressed as Mr. Hampden, but whom
we will continue to call by his proper name of Holdsworth,
turned his eyes from the shore and answered
with an effort, as though he could not at once break
away from his thoughts.</p>

<p>“I know all those places well; and there’s not a
house yonder, I may say, that doesn’t assure me I am
on familiar ground. But they tell me nothing. My
past is still a puzzle, doctor, of which these scenes are
only fragments. There are many more things to come
before I can piece it into a whole.”</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> a cure for a decayed memory? what <i>ought</i>
to revive old impressions?” exclaimed the little doctor,
hammering a snuff-box with his knuckles. “You’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
never know, Mr. Hampden, how you have weighed upon
my mind. I feel, sir, that I have no business to let you
quit this ship uncured. And yet, what more than I
have done <i>can</i> I do? I have exhausted my imagination
in questions.”</p>

<p>“Yes, doctor, you have been very kind, and I thank
you heartily for the interest you have taken in me.”</p>

<p>“Ay, but interest is of no professional use,” returned
the doctor, sniffing up a huge pinch of snuff. “We
look to results in our calling. I must say I should like
to have been able to tell Mr. Sherman when I get back
that I left you remembering everything. Eh, now?
But I don’t believe there’s a medical man living who
ever encountered such a case as yours. So much
density of mental gloom, sir, seems psychologically impossible.
If you could only have given me one end of
the thread, so to speak, I might have drawn the whole
skein out smooth. Look about you now. Here is
genuine Thames scenery, which, if you are an Englishman,
ought to go home straight to your heart and recall
a thousand matters.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth stared around him, puzzling and biting
his lip.</p>

<p>“I have often felt, and I feel now,” he exclaimed,
“that if I could see something which was prominently
identified with my past my memory would return. When
we were off Margate, I grew breathless&mdash;breathless,
doctor, believe me, under the shock of an indefinable
sensation. I made sure that my memory was about to
rush upon me&mdash;oh! it is impossible to explain what is
inexplicable to myself. But there have been moments,
since we first entered the river, when I have felt that a
revelation was close at hand&mdash;and I have trembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
whilst awaiting the flooding in of memory, which will
not come&mdash;which <i>will</i> not come!”</p>

<p>“It <i>will</i> come. The power that you possess to remember
the names and qualities of things which you see,
has long ago persuaded me that your memory is not
dead, but torpid. Keep your body up, when you get
ashore, with nourishing food. Walk the streets constantly
and use your eyes, and, when a recollection rises
to the surface, don’t rush upon it voraciously, but leave
it to its own will. Consider, memories are nothing
but shadows; you can’t dodge and drive them into
corners ...”</p>

<p>Here somebody called to him, on which the little
man shook Holdsworth’s hand, and darted towards the
group of passengers.</p>

<p>The ship was rapidly nearing Gravesend, where she
would disembark her passengers. The Thames looked
noble, with many vessels of all shapes and sizes breaking
its shining waters, with the houses and wharves ashore,
with here and there a short wooden pier running into the
stream, and the green summer country smiling beyond.</p>

<p>It was a bright July morning, and the air had an exquisite
transparency that so clarified and sharpened the
outlines of objects, that it was like looking at them
through highly-polished glass. Just such a day should
greet all homeward-sailing ships, and make their inmates
merry with a foretaste of the shore-life they are
to enjoy after their long strife with the distant treacherous
ocean.</p>

<p>Anon Gravesend opened, and then the pilot volleyed
some quick orders along the ship. Down rattled staysails,
and jibs, and yards with their spacious breadths
of canvas; and the stately vessel, denuded of her tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>ing
costume, swam lazily into position off the town.
Then rose a cry, “Stand clear of the chain-cable!” and
the second mate, on the port side of the topgallant forecastle,
brandished his arms as a warning to the people
on the main-deck to crowd out of the road.</p>

<p>“Let go the anchor!”</p>

<p>Clank! clank! went the carpenter’s hammer. And
then, with a deafening roar, down plunged the mighty
weight of iron, and tore the huge cable with shrieks
through the hawse-pipe. The ship swung slowly around
and became stationary, with many hands aloft furling
the sails, and the quarter-deck throbbing with the movements
and struggles of excited passengers.</p>

<p>And now a dozen boats, some large some small,
came tearing through the water to the ship. How the
watermen pulled! Their faces all veins, and their arms
all knots, and their hats anywhere! The canoes of
cannibals, sneaking from the secret creeks and hidden
points of an unexplored island, advance not more swiftly,
nor, maybe, with feller or more rapacious designs, upon
the intruder in their waters, than did our Gravesend
wherries upon this ship fresh from Australia.</p>

<p>Many of the watermen were soon upon the quarterdeck,
demanding monstrous sums to row three-quarters
of a mile. You saw boxes and bundles seized and disappear,
and excited ’tween-deck passengers elbowing a
lane to the gangway, fired with a resolution to disembark
or perish, while children screamed, and women implored,
and men gesticulated, and even menaced one another.
One by one the wherries put off, loaded to the gunwale
with people and baggage. These wherries returned and
returned again, until the ship was cleared of the majority
of her passengers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-bye, captain,” said Holdsworth.</p>

<p>A sunburnt man in a blue cloth coat with gilt-buttons
took Holdsworth’s hand, and grasped it cordially.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mr. Hampden, good-bye to you, sir.
Any time these three months, if you have a mind to let
me see your face, you will be able to find me out by
calling at the Jerusalem Coffee House. I shall be glad,
sir, as we all of us shall be, to hear that London has
stirred up your recollection and restored your memory.”</p>

<p>Then the chief mate and second officers and some
midshipmen pressed forward and shook his hand, and
Holdsworth, pointing out his luggage to a waterman,
descended the gangway ladder, and was rowed to
Gravesend.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now, whilst our hero, having been put ashore
and eaten a hurried dinner, climbs on top of the coach
that is to land him at Southwark, let us beguile an uninteresting
interval by casting a brief glance backwards.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the “Jessie Maxwell” at Sydney,
Holdsworth had accompanied Mr. Sherman to his house,
and been then and there established as an inmate as
long as he chose to remain. He was also given a clerkship
in Mr. Sherman’s office, worth £250 a year, which
was by no means an out-of-the-way price for a man’s
labour in Australia in those days, though in Holdsworth’s
case the salary was rendered nearly worth as
much again by his friend providing him with board
and lodging free. The truth was (1) Mr. Sherman
wanted an honest man in his office; (2) Holdsworth’s
sufferings, friendlessness, and perfect amiability, coupled
with his deprivation of memory, which affected all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
whom he conversed with as something worse even than
blindness, had obtained a permanent hold for him on
his generous patron’s sympathy long before the “Jessie
Maxwell” had sighted the Australian shore.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman was a widower and childless. A
maiden sister of his lived with him, a woman whose
character and face were as like his as an egg is to an
egg. Not knowing Holdsworth’s name, they agreed to
call him Mr. Hampden, which would serve as well as
any other, and which had at least the merit of beginning
with the letter of his real name.</p>

<p>As Mr. Hampden he was introduced to Mr. Sherman’s
friends, who took a very great interest in him. Indeed,
some of these people went to the extent of giving
dinner-parties in his honour, and for a time he was a
lion. All this attention, meant in perfect kindness,
greatly disturbed him, for his loss of memory made him
singularly sensitive, and his nervous system had entirely
given way under the extraordinary sufferings he had
endured. Mr. Sherman would have kept his secret, but
Captain Duff and the officers and men of the “Jessie
Maxwell” went and talked of him all over the city,
and then the tale of his discovery and rescue was published
in a newspaper and made the property of the
public.</p>

<p>But the public soon forgot him. The colony was
young, and the New Hollander had too many mines to
sink, and houses to build, and acres to clear, and convicts
to protest against, and home oppressions of every
species to deal with, to keep his mind long fixed on one
object. Holdsworth settled into a regular clerkly
routine, and every day improved himself in Mr. Sherman’s
opinion, by the peculiar sweetness of his amia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>bility,
and by his gratitude expressed in every delicate
form that could vehicle the emotion of his full heart.</p>

<p>There was an able doctor at that time practising in
Sydney, and Mr. Sherman invited him to his house,
and introduced him to Holdsworth, believing that, by
skilful handling, it was possible to restore the poor
fellow’s memory. But the doctor after a few weeks
shook his head, and pronounced the case hopeless, or
at least beyond the reach of human skill.</p>

<p>Indeed, rarely had a more curious and baffling problem
been submitted, than Holdsworth’s mind in those
days.</p>

<p>Here was a man capable of recollecting with precision
every incident that had befallen him since his
rescue, exhibiting shrewdness in conversation, and accuracy
in matters of current fact. His intellect was as
healthy as that of the healthiest-headed man who conversed
with him, but up to the period of his rescue
everything was in darkness. The conjectures which
were offered him&mdash;so close to the mark some of them,
that they brushed the very skirts of real facts, and told
the truth by implication&mdash;conveyed no ideas. His
eternal rejoinder was no more than a shake of the head.
Had he been a sailor? Did he remember the port from
which he sailed? the rig or name of the vessel? his
native town? Such questions, and hundreds of them,
were asked, but though he grasped familiar names with
almost passionate eagerness, they established no faintest
clue as to his real past. And then inquiries becoming
at last no better than fruitless importunities, were
dropped, and Holdsworth was considered incurable.</p>

<p>Yet this could hardly have been thought, had those
who gave in this opinion been conscious of the under-current<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
of secret, but not the less powerful, yearnings,
absolutely objectless, scarce owning definite forms,
which yet the restless instincts of the man urged with
greedy emphasis. These movements were, indeed, purely
spiritual&mdash;the action of the soul groping in her cell
and searching for that window of the mind which had
been blackened, and through which no light could
break. Of the mental torments this intellectual blindness
occasioned, no words that I possess can describe
the anguish. Month after month went by and still
found him searching heart-brokenly in the gloom for
some image, some substance, some sign, that should
appease the piteous cravings of his instincts, <i>which knew
all, but could not speak</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever feminine tact could suggest to give light
to his mind, Mr. Sherman’s sister did. She made out
a long list of names beginning with H, trusting that
one among them might be his, and that the sight of it
would recall many things or all.</p>

<p>But, long and patiently compiled as the list was,
many names there must be which she would omit; and
amongst them his own. Then she made out a list of
the names of the ships; but here was an endless job,
prosecuted for a long while with benevolent industry,
and then abandoned in despair. She read the European
papers carefully, hoping to find some account of the
loss of the vessel in which, it was surmised, Holdsworth
had been a passenger; but no such account ever rewarded
her search. Numerous were the other remedies
she resorted to, but none of them produced any result.</p>

<p>A few months of such unavailing work would soon
extinguish hope. Both she and her brother desisted
at last from their merciful endeavours in the full and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
final conviction that nothing but the hand of God
could ever draw aside the black curtain that hung over
Holdsworth’s past.</p>

<p>But not to dwell at needless length upon this part
of the story:</p>

<p>More than four years had passed since Holdsworth
had arrived in Sydney. Mr. Sherman had long learned
to think of him as settled in the colony, had increased
his salary, and congratulated himself not only on the
possession of a valuable and trustworthy assistant, but
upon a pleasant, amiable, and thoroughly gentlemanly
companion. No expression of a wish to leave had ever
escaped Holdsworth’s lips. He appeared not only contented,
but resigned to the affliction that had practically
deprived him of all knowledge of his past existence.</p>

<p>He came down to breakfast one morning with a face
betokening great agitation. Mr. Sherman was in the
breakfast-room, and instantly noticed Holdsworth’s air
of bewilderment and distress.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sherman,” exclaimed Holdsworth at once to
him, “do you remember telling me that it was possible
for my memory to be revived by a dream?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;has it happened?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell; but this much I know, that a voice
sounded last night in my ears, and bade me return at
once to England. It was a woman’s voice&mdash;it had a
clearly-remembered tone&mdash;and I knew it in my sleep;
but when I awoke and tried to recall it I could not.”</p>

<p>“But your dream?”</p>

<p>“That was all.”</p>

<p>“Was your dream merely confined to the utterance
of this voice?”</p>

<p>“I can remember nothing more than the voice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you cannot recall whose voice it resembled?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman was silent, and Holdsworth watched
him with anxiety, that was almost pathetic, so eager
was his hope that his friend would find some light in
this dim and curious night-fancy to help him with.</p>

<p>“I can see nothing serviceable in this,” said Mr.
Sherman presently, “but it is hopeful. Wait a while.
This voice may return, or you may dream something
more tangible. Remember,” he added with a smile, “that
the morning light does not flood the world suddenly.
The pale, faint gray comes first, and there are many
gradations of brightness between the first peep of dawn
and the rising of the sun.”</p>

<p>But though Holdsworth waited, the voice did not
return. Nevertheless it had sounded in his ears to some
purpose. Day by day a longing grew in him to return
to England, which became in time deep and fervent and
irresistible. Superstition was the root of this yearning;
but the poor fellow, urged by his instincts into an eternal
searching amid the darkness, would scarcely pause to
consider the nature of his keen desire, but submit to it
as an ordinance from God commissioned to impel him
into the Divine light of memory.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherman watched his increasing restlessness in
silence, waiting for him to declare his intention. He
announced it one day.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sherman, I feel guilty of deep ingratitude in
harbouring a wish to leave you. But my longing to
return to England has become so strong that I can no
longer resist it. God knows if I am not taking a foolish
step in voluntarily quitting so good and beloved a friend.
But what are these instincts which govern me? Ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
I to blind myself to them? Are they not given me for
some end which can only be accomplished by my obeying
them? I do not know what I am leaving you to
seek; but I <i>feel</i> that whatever my past may hold which
is precious to me is to be found in England.”</p>

<p>“If you have this confidence in your impulse,”
answered Mr. Sherman, “you are right in obeying it.
I am at least sure that your memory stands but a poor
chance of recovery in a strange land, surrounded by
objects which have no possible reference to your past,
and can, therefore, have no value as an appeal. I shall
be sorry, very sorry, to lose you, Mr. Hampden, but I
think I can trace the hand of Providence in this longing
of yours, and in all humbleness and sincerity I ask God
to bless your endeavours and restore you the illumination
of your memory.”</p>

<p>This resolution, now taken, was final. Mr. Sherman’s
encouragement gave new strength to Holdsworth’s
wishes, and the restlessness that beset him became almost
unbearable to him. In ten days from that date a ship
named the “Wellington” sailed for London; she was
to carry many passengers, but one saloon berth was still
vacant, and that Mr. Sherman himself procured and
paid for, for Holdsworth. Nor did his kindness stop
with this. A few days before the ship left Sydney he
asked Holdsworth if he had saved any money.</p>

<p>“Yes, four hundred pounds.”</p>

<p>“Come! that will help you along for a time. Dr.
Marlow, a friend of mine, is attending an old lady to
England. I have explained your case to him, and
begged him to give you his closest attention. He is
clever, and the long term of intimacy you will enjoy
before you reach London may be productive of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
good to you. And now do me the favour to put this
in your pocket,” he continued, handing Holdsworth a
little parcel. “No need to examine its contents now.
It is a small gift from my sister and myself. You will
find my address inside it, which will remind you to write
to us; for be sure that nobody can take more interest in
you than we do. Above all, remember that if ever you
should want a friend, you will find two very steadfast
ones in Sydney, who will rejoice to welcome you back.”</p>

<p>The parcel contained bank-notes to the value of three
hundred pounds.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN INSPIRATION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In the fine old times&mdash;the good old times&mdash;a short
journey took a long time; and it was evening when the
Gravesend coach put Holdsworth down at the door of
an old inn in Southwark named the “Green Dragon.”</p>

<p>He was now in London, but in an unfamiliar part of
it, and he stood for some minutes gazing up and down
the wide long street, with its hurrying crowds, and
thronging vehicles, and endless shops, without getting
one idea more from it than ever he had got out of Pitt
Street or George Street, or any other street in Sydney.</p>

<p>It mattered little to him where he should sleep that
night. He had as yet formed no plans as to how he
should act with respect to beginning the inquiries which
were to give him back his life’s history. So he entered
the bar of the “Green Dragon” and asked for a bedroom,
with which he was at once accommodated.</p>

<p>On descending the stairs he was encountered by a
very polite waiter, who begged to receive his orders for
refreshments. The house was a very old-established one,
and the waiter, with a smile of concern, as though the
necessity were a melancholy one that obliged him to
suggest such obvious truths at that time of day, ventured
to observe that the gentleman might travel the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
breadth and length of the United Kingdom without
meeting with better wines and choicer cooking than
were to be found at that inn. On the strength of this
and a small appetite Holdsworth ordered supper, and was
conducted to the coffee-room, where he seated himself,
the only occupant of the dark bare apartment, at a table
furnished with a mustard-pot large enough to have supplied
a hospital with poultices, and amused himself as best
he could with staring at some grisly, faded prints after
Hogarth, and a map of London, to which several generations
of flies had contributed squares, streets, and blind
alleys nowhere to be found in the metropolis proper.</p>

<p>Having eaten his supper, he was leaning back in his
chair, with a half resolution in his mind to stroll forth
into the streets for an hour, and see what suggestions
his wanderings might obtain for him, when the waiter
came up, and leaning confidentially upon the table,
informed him that there was an “’Armonious Meeting
going on in the public room at the bottom of the
passage, and if the gentleman liked, the sperits he was
pleased to horder could be served him there.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“All sorts, sir. The ’armony is done by some gents
as lives in the neighbourhood, who look in every
Wednesday night to drink and converse. The governor
takes the chair, and every gent as is stoppin’ in the
house is made welcome. I think you’ll be pleased, sir.”</p>

<p>“This is dull enough, at all events,” said Holdsworth,
looking around him. It was too early to go to bed,
and he felt too tired to take his half-projected stroll.
So, conceiving that a quarter of an hour’s inspection of
the convivialists in the public room might cheer him
up, he rose and followed the waiter down the passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The scene into which he was admitted certainly
wanted no feature of liveliness. The room was long and
low pitched, with two immense grates in it, and wooden
mantelpieces carved into all kinds of quaint embodiments
of Greek and Roman mythology. Common brass
sconces were affixed to the walls with a couple of candles
in each. Around were pictures of fighting and theatrical
celebrities of that and an earlier day; Humphreys and
Mendoza, stripped to the waist, and working into each
other’s eyes in wonderful style, watched by a distant
and pensive crowd in hats of the Tom and Jerry school,
uncomfortably tight breeches, and coat collars above
their ears; Kemble in furs; Incledon dressed as a
sailor; Braham, as little Isaac, in the “Duenna;” and
Dicky Suett, with a thing like a balloon coming out of
his mouth, and “Oh la!” written upon it. At the head
of a long table sat a stout man in a striped yellow
waistcoat, a bottle green coat, and a white neckcloth;
several black bottles, steaming jugs, and a plate of
lemons were in front of him. And down the table on
either side were seated a number of individuals, some
of them dressed in extravagant style, a few clad soberly,
and most of them smoking cigars, or rapping snuff-boxes,
laughing, talking, and drinking from fat one-legged
tumblers.</p>

<p>As Holdsworth entered, either a speech, a song, or a
sentiment had just been delivered, for there was a great
hammering going on, mingled with cries of “Bravo!”
The “cheer,” who was the promoter of, and the sole
gainer by these Wednesday festivities, bowed to Holdsworth,
and getting on to his legs, came round and bade
him welcome in the name of all the good fellows there
and then assembled, and gave him the sign, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Holdsworth, not having been made, did not take. He
then led him to a vacant chair between two of the more
soberly clad of the company, and having received and
transmitted his commands to the waiter with a host-like
and hospitable air, as though such a low arrangement
as a reckoning had no existence, resumed his place at
the head of the table, knocked loudly with his knuckles,
and called upon Mr. Harris for a song.</p>

<p>On this, up started a thin young man with a yellow
beard, and, leaning on his hands, gazed slowly around
him with a leering and perfectly self-possessed bloodshot
eye. Whereat there was a laugh.</p>

<p>“Gentleman!” he began.</p>

<p>“Order! silence!” cried the landlord. “Mr. ’Arris
has your ear!”</p>

<p>“And I wish I could say ladies: I am asked to sing
a song, and I’ll do so with the greatest of pleasure. But
before I begin, permit me to make an observation; as
I don’t want to wound any gentleman’s feelings, though
no fear of that kind will prevent me from expressing
my sentiments, which are those of a Briton and a
reformer, who has no opinion of the present, looks upon
the past with contempt, and only lives for the future.”</p>

<p>“Hear!” from several reformers.</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal to be said against this age; and
there’s no abuse which the past don’t deserve! The
past! gentlemen, it did for our grandmothers. The
present! it does for our fathers. But we, gentlemen&mdash;we
who possess young and ardent minds&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Give us your song!” cried a voice.</p>

<p>“We, gentlemen&mdash;we, the young blood of this great
nation&mdash;we,” cried the orator, swinging his fist, and
nearly knocking a cigar out of the mouth of a man at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
his side, with a face on him filled with idiotic admiration,
“are for the future!”</p>

<p>An old man uttered a cheer; the speaker then
coughed, swallowed a draught of brandy-and-water, expanded
his chest, ran his fingers through his hair, and
began as follows, throwing out his arms in approved
comic <span class="lock">style:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The sounds excited by this song were somewhat
discordant, owing to the bravos being mingled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
hisses. Mr. Harris resumed his seat with a contemptuous
expression, and the chairman, rapping the table,
called out:</p>

<p>“Gentlemen! ’issing isn’t ’armony to any ear but a
goose’s!”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the sentiments of that song,” exclaimed
a man at the bottom of the table.</p>

<p>“Why not, sir?” demanded Mr. Harris, warmly.</p>

<p>“First of all, I don’t understand ’em,” said the
other.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Mr. Harris with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Much of what that song says is to be applied to
the present as well as to the past,” observed an old
gentleman, looking staggered at his own boldness in
talking amid a silence. “For my part, I don’t think a
man fights fair who uses a two-edged sword.”</p>

<p>Several voices murmured acquiescence.</p>

<p>“I’m for the future,” said Mr. Harris, “and told you
so at the beginning.”</p>

<p>“See here, gentlemen,” called out the landlord; “the
meaning of Mr. Harris’s song, so far as I understand its
hallusions, is this: he supposes himself to be old&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” growled Mr. Harris.</p>

<p>“Quite the contrary, <i>I</i> think,” snarled a little grocer
near the chairman. “I reckon there’s more swaddling-clothes
nor expirience in <i>them</i> sentiments, or I’m gone
deaf since I sat down.”</p>

<p>“The meaning of my song is just what it says,”
retorted Mr. Harris. “I’m not ashamed of being a reformer.
Better men than I or any other gentleman in
this room, begging <i>nobody’s</i> pardon, have been reformers.
Thank God, my politics are not of a kind to call up my
blushes when I own them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Tories in the company judged that something
offensive was meant by Mr. Harris, several persons spoke
at once, and a clamour ensued which threatened to
establish the meeting on any other basis than that of
harmony. Indeed, one man, who was nearly intoxicated,
went so far as to get upon his chair and exclaim, while
he brandished his fist, that if he had it in his power, he
would hang every Whig in the country. And there is
no telling what further extravagances of language and
gesture he might have indulged in, but for the prompt
interference of a neighbour, who, catching hold of his
coat-tail, pulled him under the table.</p>

<p>However, by dint of shouting pacific language at the
top of his voice, the chairman succeeded at last in restoring
tranquillity. More grog was brought in, snuff-boxes
were handed about, hands were shaken across the table,
and loud cheers greeted the sentiment delivered by a
gentleman who appeared to be vice-chairman: “That
’armony of feeling was the music of humanity.” Mr.
Harris apologised for having sung anything distasteful
to the company, who he hoped were all his very good
friends; and amid the clanking of spoons in glasses, and
polite calls of “After you” for lighted spills, the conversation
streamed into milder channels, and everybody
did his best to look harmonious.</p>

<p>Though Holdsworth was a good deal amused by this
scene, and by the manners and dress of the people around
him, he hardly felt himself equal to enduring very much
more of this social harmony, and sat twisting his glass
on the table, watching the faces of the company, and
waiting for another “row” to make his escape without
attracting notice.</p>

<p>He was presently addressed by a man sitting on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
left&mdash;a middle-aged individual, with a thin, smooth-shaven
face and a keen eye, and very high shirt-collars.</p>

<p>“A stranger, I make bold to think, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“I judge so by an air of travel about you, if you’ll
pardon me. Forgive me, sir, if I inquire your secret&mdash;understand
me&mdash;your secret opinion as to that song just
sung by the gentleman opposite.”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth,” replied Holdsworth, who
imagined that his companion wanted to draw him into
a political argument, “I only caught a few of the verses,
and am therefore scarcely able to give an opinion.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed the other. “Now, sir, <i>I</i> call
that song clever&mdash;damned clever, and I’ll tell you why:
it’s ironical. Without irony, sir, I wouldn’t give a pin’s
head for the best piece of humour in the world. You’ll
excuse what I am about to say, sir, I’m sure. You are
a traveller&mdash;I flatter myself I can tell that with half an
eye. Now, sir, as a man who has visited other countries,
and observed human nature in a hundred different forms,
you can’t help being a Whig. Confess, sir, that you
share my political views, which are those of a man who
has only one cry&mdash;‘Down with rubbish!’”</p>

<p>“I hate rubbish as much as any man,” replied
Holdsworth.</p>

<p>His companion looked struck and delighted.</p>

<p>“Your hand, sir. Permit me to shake it. I love a
Whig, sir. Here’s to your good health.”</p>

<p>“Are you a native of this country, sir?” he continued,
glancing at Holdsworth’s dress, which had a decidedly
colonial cut.</p>

<p>“I believe so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“But not a resident?” said the other, whose turn of
mind was decidedly inquisitive.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Now what part might you have come from, sir, if
you’ll excuse the liberty?” asked the man confidently.</p>

<p>“From Australia.”</p>

<p>“God bless my heart and soul! You don’t say so!
Dear me! Australia! Is it possible? I consider
myself a bit of a traveller; but in your presence, sir, I
feel my insignificance.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth laughed, but made no answer.</p>

<p>“They say that Australia is a wonderful country,
sir: that you grow cherries with the stones outside, and
that your parrots are like sea-gulls. Fine climate
though, I believe, sir, if you will pardon me?”</p>

<p>“Very fine.”</p>

<p>“And yet not equal to ours?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p>“They talk of scenery, sir. Now I was never out
of England in my life, though there’s not a hole or
corner in it that I don’t know. But what can equal
English scenery? Take Devonshire. Take Cumberland.
Were you ever in those counties?”</p>

<p>“Never.”</p>

<p>“Yorkshire?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Talk of desolation&mdash;see the moors: great plains of
the colour of tripe stretching for miles, with one dwarf
tree for every league of ground, and that’s all. Now,
sir, my taste may be wrong, or perhaps it’s right; I
wouldn’t flaunt it in any man’s face, though I’d hold
on to it if I was on my death-bed. Of all the counties
in England, which think you I’m the most partial to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“I cannot imagine.”</p>

<p>“Kent, sir!” exclaimed the man, drawing back
triumphantly.</p>

<p>The name sent a thrill through Holdsworth. He
pricked his ears and looked at his companion earnestly.</p>

<p>“The Devonshire people may crack up their county,
but give <i>me</i> Kent. I am a native of Kent, sir!”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“I was born at Canterbury. Ever seen the
cathedral?”</p>

<p>“Canterbury Cathedral!” muttered Holdsworth,
struggling to grasp an illusive, half-formed fancy that
flitted across his mind.</p>

<p>“Take the country about Hanwitch, now ...”</p>

<p>“Hanwitch!” echoed Holdsworth. The name pierced
him as a sword might. He pressed his fingers tightly
over his eyes, his face turned white, and his whole
body trembled.</p>

<p>His companion stared at him.</p>

<p>“Do you know Hanwitch?” he asked, wondering if
this singular-looking person with the haggard face,
Australian clothes, and thick beard was in possession of
his right mind.</p>

<p>“The name struck me,” answered Holdsworth,
removing his hands and frowning in his effort to master
the meaning of the extraordinary emotion excited by
the name of that town.</p>

<p>“There’s not a spot of land anywhere within thirty
miles of Canterbury all round,” continued the man,
looking at Holdsworth watchfully, “that I don’t know.
I name Hanwitch because there’s a bit of river scenery
near it which is prettier than anything I’ve seen in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
other part of England. If you’ve got the leisure, and
would like to see what this country can show in the
way of good views, take a run down to Hanwitch.”</p>

<p>He pulled out a pocket-book, and extracting a card,
handed it to Holdsworth, observing in a tone that at
least showed he had regained his confidence in his
neighbour:</p>

<p>“Show that, sir, at the bar of the ‘Three Stars’ at
Hanwitch, and if you don’t get every attention, be good
enough to write to me, and see if they don’t lose my
patronage.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth looked at the card, whereon he might
have seen a very commonplace name, printed in capitals,
with “Commercial Traveller” squeezed into the corner;
but he saw nothing. A name had been pronounced
which quickened the dormant memory in him into a
vitality that threatened to make it burst through the
shell that imprisoned it, and proclaim all that he passionately
longed to know.</p>

<p>Powerless must his mind have been not to find in
the name of the Hanwitch inn the magic to give him
back his memory. Could not his heart recall the sweet
day he had spent in Hanwitch with Dolly at his side?&mdash;the
sweetest, happiest day of all the days he had
passed in the brief three months during which they had
been together? One might have thought that, saving
her own dear face, there was nothing more potent to
roll back the deep mantle of darkness, and lay bare the
shining panorama of those far-off times, than the name
of the inn in whose deep bay window they had sat
linked in each other’s arms, watching the soft sunshine
shimmering through the summer leaves, and the clear
river wandering gently along its emerald-banked channel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Further conversation was out of the question for a
while, by the chairman hammering on the table and
calling silence for a song. The disagreeable effects produced
by the last song had completely passed away, and
the landlord thought that another “ditty,” as he called
it, might safely be sung.</p>

<p>A very corpulent man stood up, with a face upon
him of which the quantity of flesh had worked the
expression into an aspect of fixed amazement. An immense
blue-spotted cravat adorned his throat, and long
streaks of hair fell slanting down his cheeks. His small
clothes and arm-sleeves were distressingly tight, and
suggested that any display of pathos or humour, of
gesticulation or laughter, would be in the highest
degree inconvenient. It was not hard to guess that
this fat man sang comic songs, that he dropped <i>every</i> h,
and that he was in the eating-line, in a commercial
sense.</p>

<p>He was saluted with a round of laughter, which,
being hammered down, he began in a soft, oily, tenor
<span class="lock">voice&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>This song gave such exquisite satisfaction to the company
that, on his concluding it, he was entreated, amid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
cheers, to sing another; on which, squaring his breast,
but preserving his wooden face of fat astonishment, he
began as follows:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>I spare the reader the remaining six verses of this delectable
song. The company joined in the chorus with
the full force of their lungs, and so exhilarated the fat
vocalist, that at the end of the second verse he pushed
away his chair, and folding his arms on his breast,
actually danced an accompaniment to the words, amid
shrieks of laughter and wild stretching forward of necks
at the farther end of the table to see him. Holdsworth’s
companion laughed until he grew faint, and then, to
recover his strength, drank brandy and water, and then
laughed again. The song was encored, genuine vulgarity
seldom failing to please; and then a brief breathing-space
of silence falling, Holdsworth said to his
companion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you tell me how I am to get to Hanwitch
from here?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. All you’ve got to do is, step across to
the ‘Canterbury Arms’&mdash;it’s five minutes’ walk from
this house on the left&mdash;the coach starts for Canterbury
at half-past seven in the morning, every day.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Holdsworth, who found it impossible,
amid the renewed hubbub of conversation that
had burst out, to ask some questions about Hanwitch,
which might help him to understand the longing that
possessed him to visit it.</p>

<p>“You’re not going&mdash;the night’s very young, sir?”
said the man, seeing Holdsworth rise. But Holdsworth
merely wished him “Good night,” and slipped out of
the room unnoticed by the company, who were at that
moment busy in entreating the fat man to give them
another song.</p>

<p>The cool air and silence of the passage were a great
relief after the heat and noise of the public room. It
was now drawing near to eleven o’clock. Holdsworth
went to the bar and asked for a candle, and was lighted
to his bed-room by a chambermaid with ringlets and
black eyes, who probably felt surprised that her charms
attracted no notice whatever from the gentleman, who
seemed to find pleasure in no other object than the
carpet on which he trod.</p>

<p>Holdsworth closed the door, and a whole hour passed
before he rose to remove his clothes. There was something
in the recollection of the thrill which the name
of Hanwitch had sent through him, that impelled him
to bend the whole energies of his mind to the word,
and he strove with memory passionately and fiercely,
but could not wrench a syllable from her. He repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the name until it lost even its sense as the designation
of a town. Nevertheless, every moment made his longing
to visit it deeper. There must be <i>some</i> reason why
this name had so stirred him. The names of other
English counties and cities had been pronounced before
him and by him over and over again, but they touched
no chord, they awoke no echo in his mind, however
dim and elusive.</p>

<p>If memory would only define the object he sought!
This it would not do. He was a wanderer, obeying the
dictation of blind instinct, which urged without guiding
him. Of all his past, nothing was present to his mind.
He knew not what he sought. His was an affliction
crueller than blindness, for a blind man could say: “A
beloved one has strayed from me. I seek her. I see
not, indeed, those who surround me, but my mission
has form and substance in my mind, and my inquiries
cannot <i>always</i> prove fruitless.” But Holdsworth was
commanded by a mysterious emotion which controlled
without enlightening him. <i>Something</i> had been lost&mdash;<i>something</i>
was to be found. He felt his want, but could
not explain it to himself. No man could help him,
since no man could guess what was the thing he looked
for.</p>

<p>When he left his chair he sank upon his knees and
asked God in broken tones to help him&mdash;to direct him
into the path that should lead him to the light&mdash;to aid
him in his yearning to re-illuminate his memory.</p>

<p>If a man has one good reason for being grateful for
living in these times, it is because they are <i>not</i> coaching
days.</p>

<p>The old stage-coach, the Wellerian coachman, the
spruce guard with his horn and his jokes, the fat
people inside, the gruff people outside, all contributed
a picturesque detail to the age they belonged to; but
I have generally found that the more picturesque an
object is, the fitter it is to be surveyed at a distance
only.</p>

<p>If in the days to which the old stage-coach belonged
it never rained, it was never cold, one was never in a
hurry, there were no missions of life and death to make
one curse the delay of a moment&mdash;if one’s companions
were always good-tempered, and one’s body was so constituted
as to endure jerks and jolts and a sitting posture
for hours at a stretch without inconvenience&mdash;then the
old stage-coach may be conceived to have been a very
agreeable means of locomotion. But as I have been
informed by several elderly gentlemen that the weather
forty years ago was pretty much the same sort of weather
that it now is, that strokes of death and strokes of business
requiring immense despatch happened then as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
happen every day; in a word, that in most atmospherical,
moral, and civic respects the early years of this
century differed but very little from these its maturer
days, I can only repeat, in spite of the protests of several
venerable friends who seem to find most things (even
whilst enjoying them) objectionable which are not as
aged as themselves, that if we have one excuse better
than another for being on good terms with the times
we live in, it is because the picturesque old stage-coach
makes no condition of our daily existence.</p>

<p>Hanwitch was about fifty miles from London. To-day
a traveller would be carried the distance in about
an hour and three-quarters. Holdsworth, starting at
half-past seven in the morning, would, providing that
the coach did not break down or overturn, reach the
town at about four o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>He awoke at half-past six, and at once rose. The
morning was a bright one, but all the efforts of the
sunshine to squeeze itself through the wire blinds and
dusty panes of the coffee-room windows could not avail
to communicate the faintest spark of cheerfulness to the
dingy apartment, with its bare tables and blue-coloured
looking-glass over the chimney, and the old-fashioned
prints around the walls, suggestive, one knew not why,
of London milk and discoloured blankets.</p>

<p>The waiter came in, looking dejected, limp, and fluey,
and perhaps to pay Holdsworth out for neglecting to
leave word at the bar before going to bed, that he should
want to breakfast at an unreasonable hour, declaimed a
bill of fare, nearly every item of which, as Holdsworth
named it, he declared could not possibly be got ready
before half-past eight. Cold ham and tea must suffice,
with which order the waiter sleepily withdrew, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
a long absence returned&mdash;when Holdsworth was on the
point of starting up and leaving the house in the full
belief that he should miss the coach&mdash;bearing a teapot
of which the contents looked like rain-water, a loaf of
bread as hard and slippery as glass under the knife, a
lump of butter of the colour and perfume of soaked
cheese, and a ham of which what was not bone was
brine.</p>

<p>Very lightly breaking his fast with these things,
Holdsworth called for his bill, and obtaining the services
of the Boots to carry his portmanteau, which was all
the baggage he had brought with him from Australia,
walked to the house from which the Canterbury coach
started.</p>

<p>It wanted but ten minutes of the starting-time, but
no coach was visible. However, it was up the yard, and
would be brought round in a few minutes, the book-keeper
said. As these few minutes threatened to expand into
half an hour, Holdsworth entered the bar of the “Canterbury
Arms” to obtain a biscuit and some brandy-and-water,
partly to complete the wretched breakfast he had
made, and partly to exterminate the vile flavour of the
tea that lingered in his mouth.</p>

<p>When he returned, the coach was out, the horses
were in, several passengers were getting into, or climbing
on top of, the vehicle; the coachman, muffled about
the throat as though the month were November, and
the air full of snow, stood on the pavement, smoking a
cigar and surveying the whole picture with a lordly and
commanding, though a somewhat inflamed eye; and the
busy scene was completed by a body of boys and men
offering newspapers, walking-sticks, knives, combs, and
broad sheets of songs to the passengers, and striving to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
drown each other’s importunities with loud and ceaseless
clamour.</p>

<p>Off went the coach at last, with Holdsworth by the
coachman’s side. The wheels rattled over the hard
roads, the houses in long lines swept by, lost by degrees
their frowsy exteriors and dingy metropolitan aspects,
and attempted little revelations of bucolic life in small
gardens, with glimpses of trees in the rear. Then came
houses standing alone in grounds of their own, cottages
purely pastoral in appearance, with the noise of farmyards
about them, and their atmosphere sweetened by
the smell of hay and flowers. These dropped away, the
breeze grew pure and elastic, the country opened in
wide spaces of waving cornfields spotted with bright
poppies, and swelling meadow lands and green fields
shaded by groups of trees, with here and there a lark
whistling in the blue sky, and all London lying behind,
marking its mighty presence by a haze that seemed to
stretch for miles and miles, and paled the heavens to
the hue of its own complexion.</p>

<p>Holdsworth was such bad company that the coachman
soon ceased his “observations” touching the different
scenes through which they passed, and addressed
himself to his companion on the right, a young gentleman
who was going as far as Chatham, and who lighted
several large cigars in less than half an hour, pulling at
them with hollows in his cheeks, and looking at the ash
of them, and preserving a very pale face. Holdsworth
had something else to think about than the coachman’s
refined and classical remarks, delivered from the depth
of three shawls. The quick rolling of the coach over
the smooth turnpike-road was inducing an exhilaration
that acted upon him as good wine acts upon the brain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
giving clearness and freedom to thought, and causing
life to be felt at her most secret sources. There was
the impression in his mind that he had once before
travelled on the top of a stage-coach along this very
road, though when, or under what circumstances, or
whether he had actually performed the journey or had
read of some one else having done it, he could not tell.
The scenery they were travelling through was altogether
delicious, and better than a cordial to a man who had
just landed from a three and a half months’ voyage at
sea. The aspect of the country was full of that sober
sweetness of general effect which soothes the heart with
a deep sense of home; of broad yellow tracts burnished
by the sunshine, of the delicate shadowing of green, and
the neutral tint of fallow soil; houses made as dainty
by distance as pictures on ivory; great trees spreading
their broad abundant leaves over cool spaces of gleaming
water; with the animation, now and again, of
human life, where men worked in the fields, or where
children sported before the houses, stopping their frolics
to cheer the coach, while women held babies high in
their hands and swayed to the delighted plunging of
the chubby limbs.</p>

<p>Holdsworth, however, was by no means a sample of
the “outsides” carried by the coach, whatever the deportment
of the invisible “insides” might have been.
There were some half-a-dozen people on the roof, including
two girls, one of whom was decidedly pretty and the
other decidedly coquettish. These young ladies, at the
first going off, had been ceaseless in the expression of
their fears that, though it was true they were up all
right, they should never be able to get down again. A
gentleman with a turn-up nose, expressive of the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
self-complacency, had taken it upon himself to comfort
the ladies, by remarking that getting down was in every
case easier than getting up, because the natural tendency
of the human body was to fall; at which the ladies had
murmured “Impertinence!” and “Some people are
better seen than heard,” and such-like scathing phrases,
thereby sanctioning the display of such wit as the turn-up-nosed
gentleman possessed, which he exerted with
such good effect that the ladies grew crimson under uncontrollable
fits of laughter. Then the guard struck in,
and provoked the other outsiders to talk; and presently
a large flat bottle was handed around, which had the
effect of making everybody who put it to his or her lips
merrier still. Onwards rattled the coach with its noisy,
laughing burden, flinging sounds of life broadcast over
the green country, provoking many a pair of slow bucolic
eyes to stare it gravely out of sight, raising clouds of
dust as the wheels went softly over the floury highway,
spinning under mile-lengths of trees darkening the road
with twinkling shadows, and throbbing with the piercing
shrilling of innumerable birds buried in the dense foliage,
catching the hot sunshine again in the open, and gleaming
like a gigantic looking-glass as it sped gaily forward
under the broad eye of Heaven.</p>

<p>It was two o’clock when they changed horses for the
second time at a smart little Kentish town, with a gray
ruin right in its midst, and an old church hard by it,
with one of the snuggest of rectories peeping at the
world out of the silence and shadow of a rich orchard.
Some of the “insides” got out here and went their ways,
and were no more seen. The young ladies on the roof
were entreated to alight by the small-nosed man, but
this they noisily refused to do, the mere idea of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
thing causing them to catch hold of each other. The
delay, however, was a short one. The jaded horses,
with streaks of white foam upon their polished hides,
were taken out and fresh ones put in; the coachman,
smelling strongly of gin and peppermint, climbed into
his place, cracked his whip, and off started the coach,
followed by a crowd of excited boys, who chased it clear
of the town and then threw stones after it.</p>

<p>“Where might you be for, sir?” inquired the coachman
of Holdsworth, speaking out of his stomach like a
ventriloquist.</p>

<p>“Hanwitch.”</p>

<p>“Several stoppages afore Hanwitch,” said the coachman.</p>

<p>“How many?”</p>

<p>“Vy, there’s Saltwell, Halton, Gadstone, and Southbourne.”</p>

<p>“Southbourne?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Southbourne, of course. That’s the willage
jist afore Hanwitch.”</p>

<p>“Southbourne! Southbourne!” repeated Holdsworth,
with the old look of bewilderment that invariably entered
his face when some familiar name was sounded in his ear.</p>

<p>The coachman glanced at him over his shawls, and
said to himself, quite in the pit of his stomach. “You’re
a rum ’un, you are!”</p>

<p>“P’raps you ar’n’t acquainted with the road, sir?”
said he.</p>

<p>“I think&mdash;I am sure I know Southbourne,” replied
Holdsworth. “What sort of place is it?”</p>

<p>“Vot sort o’ place? Vy, a willage.”</p>

<p>“But what kind of village?”</p>

<p>“All that I know is this, there’s a hinn there vere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
they serves you vith werry good liquor. Blow’d if I
can tell you anything furder. But that’s my veakness,
sir. Vould you believe me, I’ve drove coaches through
that willage for the last two-and-twenty year, and may
I be bil’d if I can tell you anything about it.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth sank into deep thought, while the coachman,
twisting his eyes over his shawls, examined his face
and clothes with side-long attention; then his curiosity
being evidently aroused by something in Holdsworth’s
appearance which widely differed from the cut and style
of the passengers he was in the habit of carrying, he
said:</p>

<p>“Might you be a furriner, sir?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“I’ve a brother in Californy. P’raps you might know
them parts, sir?”</p>

<p>“I have just returned from Australia.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the coachman, looking staggered;
“that’s a good vays off ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“The other side of the world.”</p>

<p>“Gor bless me! A queer place, I’ve heerd. Full of
conwicks. One of our guards was sent out there t’other
day for abstracting of money from a wallis.”</p>

<p>This reference operating upon his sympathies, he
entered into a story, as long as a newspaper account, of
the trial; “how beautiful the counsill as hadvocated the
pore fellow spoke, vich the court vos crowded vith
coachmen, who groaned venhever the hadvocate as vos
opposed to the guard began to speak, vich behaviour,
though it warn’t p’raps quite correck, vasn’t to be stopped
nohows, although the judge looks werry fierce, and the
counsill kep’ on sayin’, ‘My lud, if this here noise ain’t
stopped, I’ll throw the case up,’ vich was just the thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the coachmen vanted” (here he made as though he
would poke Holdsworth in the ribs with the butt-end of
his whip); “but, lor’ save yer, it was no go.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth paid no attention to this story, his mind
being engaged in a desperate struggle with memory.
Indeed, the word “Southbourne” had affected him as
no other allusion had. Pale, dim phantoms of memory,
comparable to nothing so much as the phosphorescent
outlines which the eye may mark fluctuating in the black
sea-water, rose and sank in his mind; and though
whispering nothing to his breathless anxiety, clearly
proving that the faculty which he had long believed
dead was beginning to stir and awaken.</p>

<p>One by one the towns and villages named by the
coachman had been passed, and now Southbourne was
to come.</p>

<p>An indescribable anxiety, at once breathless and
thrilling, suspending, it seemed to him, the very
pulsations of his heart, making his breath come and go
in quick, fierce respirations, possessed Holdsworth.</p>

<p>He held his hands tightly clasped; all colour had
fled from his face, and his deep-sunk eyes glowed with
unnatural fire.</p>

<p>Repeatedly he muttered to himself, “What does
this portend?”</p>

<p>Already his prophetic soul had caught the light, and
seemed to know herself, and maddened him and wrung
his frame with her wild and bitter struggles to proclaim
her inspiration and pierce her reflected beam through
the film that still blinded the eye of the mind.</p>

<p>The sun was still high, and flung its yellow brilliance
over the fair and gilded prospect. The coach had
turned the corner of the long road that led straight as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
an arrow into Southbourne; and far away at the extremity,
in mingled shadow and shine, the few houses
could be seen, with the spire of St. George’s Church
rearing high its flaming vane, and on the left the gleam
of the river shadowed by many trees.</p>

<p>“There’s Southbourne!” said the coachman, pointing
with his whip.</p>

<p>The dust whirled in a cloud behind the wheels, the
guard sounded his horn, and with a rush and a rattle
the coach drew up opposite the “Hare and Hounds,” a
tavern as familiar to Holdsworth as the sight of his
own hand.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” cried the coachman. “Hi, you there!
Help! A glass o’ brandy! Blowed if the gentleman
hasn’t fainted!”</p>

<p>“Fainted!” cried the young ladies on the top of the
coach, leaning forward to catch a sight of his face.</p>

<p>No, not fainted; but struck down by a revelation
such as, had the two young ladies and the small-nosed
man and the coachman been told the story of it, would
have supplied them with enough matter to keep them
talking without intermission as long as the coach-wheels
turned.</p>

<p>Memory, coming out of the little house at the bottom
of the long familiar thoroughfare, out of the little house
that turned its shoulder upon the highway and parted
it into lanes, had rushed upon him like an armed man,
and struck him a staggering blow. He had dropped
under it, and, but for the support of the apron over
his knees, would have fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>The guard ran into the tavern and returned with a glass
of brandy, which the coachman put to Holdsworth’s lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, I am better now,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Glad to hear it,” said the coachman.</p>

<p>“I will get down here.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you booked for Hanwitch!” exclaimed the
guard, who imagined that the gentleman’s head
wandered.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;this will do&mdash;I will go no further. Help me
with your hand&mdash;thank you.”</p>

<p>He reached the ground, watched by a group of
persons who made a movement as though to support
him, when they saw him swaying to and fro like a
drunken man, and staring fixedly down the road. But
in a moment or two, with a struggle, he stood firm.
His portmanteau was handed out and carried into the
bar. The guard took his place; the coachman, with a
glance over his shawls to see that Holdsworth stood
clear of the wheels, jerked the reins, and the coach
rattled out of sight.</p>

<span class="smaller">SOUTHBOURNE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Right in the middle of the road stood Holdsworth,
casting his eyes first to the right, then to the left, then
letting them rest fixedly on the house at the extremity.</p>

<p>Here was the scene, the place at last, that was to
roll back the curtains which hid the past from him, and
to proclaim the resurrection of the life within him that
for years had slept a sleep as deep as death.</p>

<p>There he stood, brought by God’s hand from a far-off
world into the little Kentish village, where his
memories lay heaped, where association made a beacon
of every humble house to lead him with unerring step
backward and backward to the sweetest, the dearest of
all his memories.</p>

<p>How remembered, how deeply remembered, the
scene! The old tavern on the right, with its swinging
signboard, its burnished latticed windows, the great elm
tree spreading its branches, like soft fingers, over the
red-tiled roof; the farmhouse facing it, with the clamour
of hidden poultry all about it, softened by the cooing of
doves; and the cherry and apple trees stretching forth
their fruit over the wooden railing, and the strings of
white linen drying in the open spaces among the trees;
the vista of gable-peaked houses, the old shops, the
grassy land between the houses, the blacksmith’s shed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the hens in the roadway, the children on the doorsteps,
the women working at the open windows, and the little
house at the extremity, backed by soft masses of green
trees and the delicate blue of the afternoon sky.</p>

<p>He knew his life’s history as he surveyed this scene,
as though a voice in his ear were whispering it all to
him. The chain was too complete not to suggest the
unseen links; the throng of associations was too manifold
and pregnant not to reveal to his mind the things
which his eyes beheld not. Swiftly and fiercely&mdash;a very
whirlwind of logic&mdash;thought flew over each stepping-stone
to the hidden past; and then he knew what he
had left, what he was now to seek, and what had been
the <span class="smcap lowercase">WANT</span> which his instincts&mdash;that deeper life of his of
which the movements were independent of the senses&mdash;had
never lost sight of.</p>

<p>When his faintness had passed, a great joy took possession
of him&mdash;an impulse so keenly exhilarating, that
he could have cried aloud in his rapture. But then
came a revulsion&mdash;a deadly fear&mdash;of what he knew not,
save that its presence turned him into ice, and damped
his forehead with sweat.</p>

<p>He was all unconscious of the eyes that were upon
him; but some one approaching made him turn his
head, and he saw several persons watching him curiously
from the door of the inn, while others, plain country
people in smocks and highlows, muttered to one another
as they stared from the pavement.</p>

<p>“Won’t you please to step in, sir?” said the man
who came forward, a short, square-faced individual, in
a black calico apron and a white hat.</p>

<p>“Who lives in that house?” returned Holdsworth,
pointing down the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“That one yonder, with the chimbley looking this
way? Why, I don’t think anybody’s living in it just
now, although I did hear that it was taken by a party
from Ashford.&mdash;Emily!” he called.</p>

<p>A stout, well-looking woman elbowed her way out
of the tavern, and stood on the lower step.</p>

<p>“The gentleman wants to know who lives in that
house at the bottom.”</p>

<p>“It’s to let. Mr. Markham has the letting of it,”
answered the woman.</p>

<p>“His is the shop yonder,” said the man. “You’ll
see ‘Undertaker and Joiner’ wrote over the door.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send a boy to fetch him, if you like,” said the
woman.</p>

<p>“I’ll goa, missus,” remarked an old man in a long
blouse, turning about on his stick in his eagerness to
earn a glass of yale.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want him,” said Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“Won’t you step in and rest yourself, sir?” exclaimed
the woman, exerting the seductive smile with which
she was wont to greet every passenger who stopped at
her door.</p>

<p>Holdsworth hesitated a moment, as though there
were a magic in the little distant house that constrained
him to keep his eyes upon it, and then entered the tavern,
heralded by the landlady, and followed by the landlord.</p>

<p>The parlour into which he was conducted was as
quiet and private as he could wish, screened by a red
curtain across the glass of the door from the bar, with
a window opening on to a square of ground well stocked
with shrubs and vegetables. The sunshine streamed
into the room, and lighted up the queer ornaments on
the mantelpiece, the fine old china hanging upon rows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of hooks in a mahogany cabinet, the well-worn carpet,
the velvet sofa, the black bottles and glittering tankards
on the shelves of the sideboard.</p>

<p>The landlord went behind the bar to look after some
besmocked gentry who were drinking in front of it,
leaving his wife to attend to Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“What might you like to order, sir?” she inquired,
presenting herself at a side door.</p>

<p>He asked her to bring him some wine and biscuits,
saying that he had no appetite now, but would dine or
sup later on. He looked at her very attentively as he
spoke, with an idea in his mind that he had seen her
before.</p>

<p>She went away, and he left his seat and paced the
room with a wild look of distress on his face, and bitter
anxiety and fear in his heart. Once he snatched up
his hat and advanced to the door, but hesitated and resumed
his agitated walk. His feelings were those of a
man just awakened to consciousness from the effects of a
blow that had stunned him. His body trembled, his lips
worked, and he held his hands squeezed tightly together.
His sufferings were indeed terrible. He looked back
upon the blank of five years and recoiled before the
conjectures his heart prompted as to the things which
had happened in that time. Sometimes his impulse
was to rush forth and cry aloud for Dolly, and then a
deadly chill came over him, and he shut his eyes and
beat aside his thoughts, as though they were something
tangible and apart from him, with his hand.</p>

<p>When the door opened, he bit his lip to control
himself, and kept his back turned upon the woman in
feigned inspection of a print upon the wall. As she
was about to withdraw, he looked at her and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you lived long in Southbourne?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, many years.”</p>

<p>He seated himself and drank a glass of wine.</p>

<p>“How many years?”</p>

<p>“Oh, twelve, thirteen. Ah, more like fifteen years,
sir!”</p>

<p>“So long! Then you know all the people here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I daresay I do,” answered the woman,
putting her hands under her apron, and examining
Holdsworth’s face and clothes with great curiosity.</p>

<p>“Who last lived in that house at the bottom of the
street?”</p>

<p>“You mean the one you was askin’ my husband
about?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Fairchild, the butcher, after he sold his business
about two years ago.”</p>

<p>“Who before Mr. Fairchild?”</p>

<p>“It stood empty awhile after Mrs. Holdsworth left
it.”</p>

<p>“Where is she now?”</p>

<p>“Livin’ at Hanwitch, along with her husband, Mr.
Conway, the dentist.”</p>

<p>The woman’s eyes, when she made this answer,
were on the garden; when she looked again at Holdsworth,
his face was turned from her.</p>

<p>“Did you know any of the parties, sir, as you’re
asking about?” she inquired.</p>

<p>He did not answer her, and she, thinking that he
had not heard her, continued:</p>

<p>“I was servant along with poor Mr. Newcome before
the old gentleman died, and saw a good deal of Mrs.
Holdsworth, as I always call her; for, somehow, I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
never bear to think of her as Mrs. Conway, for her
heart never went with her hand when she married that
gentleman, as I can bear witness to, for I was at the
wedding, and never saw a poor body cry as she did.
She and her grandmother, old Mrs. Flemming, was often
at the rectory ... but I beg pardon, sir; you was
speaking of the house. I can’t remember who had it
before Mrs. Holdsworth. It’s a long time ago.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth raised his head.</p>

<p>Up to the moment of her speaking of Dolly he had
not known his own name; all other memories had returned
to him, save that. His face was very white, but
there was a strong expression in it. If the woman were
to talk for another twelve hours, she could add nothing
more to what she had already said. Dolly’s death he
had expected as he had expected a hundred other nameless
possibilities, when memory swooped upon him and
set him peering over the edge of the chasm that separated
the Then from the Now; but not her marriage.
Not that. In all the hours he had passed in the open
boat at sea, beholding death striking down his companions
about him, suffering the exquisite torture of
thirst, the yet more exquisite pang of hopelessness, there
was no moment of agony in all that time comparable to
the agony that now wrenched him. It might be one of
those terrible experiences which break the heart or
transform the nature, but it gave to or found in Holdsworth
a quality of endurance that enabled him to front
the extremity with a face of marble.</p>

<p>When next he spoke his voice was low, but without
a tremor in it.</p>

<p>“I am interested in Mrs. Conway and her old
grandmother. Tell me what you know about them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“Surely, sir, you don’t bring news of Mr. Holdsworth&mdash;of
the fine young man that went to sea and was
shipwrecked?” inquired the woman with a face of
excitement, and staring hard, as if she were about to
receive some astounding news.</p>

<p>“No, no!” he answered, almost under his breath;
and then he added, “Tell me what you know of the
widow.”</p>

<p>“I remember Mr. Holdsworth well,” said the woman,
her speech answering to her mood. “A handsomer
young fellow I never saw. He used often to be at the
rectory with his wife, and the love between them was
something beautiful. How she ever had the heart to
let him leave her I never could guess. But he went
and was drowned, and left the young thing without
a friend or a shilling in the wide world, God help
her; and though I said it was almost stupid her marrying
Mr. Conway, remembering what love there was
between her and Mr. Holdsworth, yet I have always
believed it was for her child’s sake that she married the
dentist, for they were in desperate want when he
courted her, and must have starved for want of help.”</p>

<p>“You are speaking of Holdsworth’s child?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. A bright little thing, and fair as a lily.
I saw her the other day when I was over at Hanwitch.
She was with her mamma, and I never see such a likeness
as there is between her and her poor drowned
papa. But you’re askin’ about old Mrs. Flemming.
Why, she died four years ago. She was very old, and
went off quite peaceful, they said. What with Mrs.
Flemming’s death, and her never getting any news of
her husband, and having a tiny little baby to find food
for, I do think the poor young lady’s heart nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
broke. I never heard exactly how the money matter
was with her, but I believe that when Mrs. Flemming
died she would have nothing to live on but her
husband’s pay, which was stopped when he was given up
for lost. Mr. Newcome was very kind, and paid her
rent, and helped her along while he lived; and then
Mr. Conway saw her; but it was a long time before
she would marry him, long after the poor old rector was
dead and gone, and she found that taking in needlework
was worse than going on the parish. I often
think of her&mdash;I do, indeed, sir&mdash;waiting day after day
for her husband, who was never to come home. I’d
rather, myself, have married anybody than a sailor.
There’s no telling, when once they go, whether they’ll
ever come back again. They’re worse nor soldiers for
that.”</p>

<p>Here the woman, suddenly conceiving that she had
talked quite enough, and perhaps a little too much,
dropped a courtesy and left the room; but came back
again to ask two questions&mdash;At what hour would the
gentleman please to dine? and would he like to have a
bed-room in her house? She could recommend her
bed-rooms. Her linen was clean as snow.</p>

<p>“I will tell you presently,” answered Holdsworth.
“I have not yet decided upon my movements.”</p>

<p>“There’s a nice plump fowl&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, cook me that by seven o’clock,” said Holdsworth,
who was feverishly impatient to be left alone.</p>

<p>She closed the door, and Holdsworth leaned his
temples on his hands and fixed his heavy eyes on the
bare table, taking the attitude of a student striving to
master some difficult problem.</p>

<p>For many minutes he held this posture, presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
lifted his head, and looked about him; then took his
hat and went out.</p>

<p>The landlord behind the bar made him a low bow,
and offered his services to show him over the village.
Holdsworth declined his offer with a “Thank you,” and
walked into the road. He glanced over his shoulder
suspiciously as he advanced, disliking the inquisitive
stare with which he had been followed through the bar
of the inn by the people drinking there, but no one
watched him. He held a stick, on which he leaned as he
moved, like an infirm man; and often he paused and
gazed around him. The people in the roadway, or in
the houses, eyed him as he passed with the curiosity a
stranger seldom fails to excite in small unfrequented
places; but he took no notice of them; his mind was
intent on vivifying the impressions it was receiving with
old memories, and adjusting the ideas which had been
restored to him out of the dark and secret hiding-places
of the past.</p>

<p>Few changes had been made in the aspect of the
little village to embarrass the picture which his recovered
memory had submitted to him. Some alterations
in the external form of one or two shops, and two
freshly-built houses on the left-hand side facing the
blacksmith’s shed, were the only new features in the
familiar scene of this quaint broad thoroughfare.</p>

<p>His steps grew more reluctant, his face took a sharper
expression of pain, though never losing its characteristic
of hardness and severity, as he drew near to his old
home. He forced himself forwards, and, when abreast,
halted and looked at it.</p>

<p>The windows were blindless, the garden showed
signs of long neglect, and a board nailed to a post<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
leaned towards the road, bearing the announcement, in
painted letters, that the house was to let. A row of
cobwebs garnished the woodwork of the gate, and
glistened in the sunshine; the bare rooms, visible
through the windows, looked cheerless and inhospitable;
the window-glass was dirty, and some of the
panes in the kitchen window were broken. The grass
about the house was tall and vividly green. That
window, looking towards the trees between the lanes,
belonged to Dolly’s room. There were white soft
curtains to it in those days, and the glass was pure and
transparent as spring-water. That room on the left
was the sitting-room. There they had taken their meals;
there they had played forfeits, had hunted the slipper,
had made the walls ring with innocent laughter. He
remembered the old grandmother’s placid smile, the
rector’s kindly jokes, his Dolly’s sweet face, throwing a
light of purity and beauty about her. And under the
sill were the dead branches of the clematis, still held
to the wall by the pieces of black leather Dolly’s own
hand had nailed. Such humble signs make grief sharper
than large memorials.</p>

<p>He stood leaning upon his stick, losing all sense of
the present in this vision of the past. His thoughts,
taking their departure from the time when he first fitted
out that house as a home for Dolly, flowed regularly
downwards. He was a bridegroom again, and his wife
was at his side, and her eyes upon his, and their hands
clasped. Now the shadow of separation that was to
darken them presently was felt; and then came the eve
of his departure, thronged with the memory of kisses
sweet and bitter, of tears and broken prayers, and brave
hopes battling with sullen misgivings. He was now on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
board the “Meteor,” and now in the open boat, surrounded
by the dying, and himself suffering tortures it
broke him down to recall; and now he was in Australia,
striving with memory, which would yield no answer to
his passionate prayers. But the finger of God pointed
the way to his old home; and now he was returning to
England, with his past still hidden in gloom, but with
his heart not unhopeful of the morning that was to
break after the long darkness of the night. And finally,
with the old village of Southbourne before him, came
the rush of memory&mdash;the brief exultation&mdash;the spasm
of fear&mdash;the terror that held him mute&mdash;the disclosure
that showed him his wife less his than had he traversed
all the desolate miles of water only to kneel by
her grave....</p>

<p>Tears would have relieved him, but he could not
weep. He turned and moved slowly away, stopping
again and again to look back at the little empty house,
while sobs convulsed him, and a sense of supreme desolation
and friendlessness weighed him down.</p>

<span class="smaller">REFLECTIONS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The fowl dished up by the landlady and served upon
fine linen, was plump, and juicy and aromatic enough to
re-excite the appetite of an alderman after Mansion
House dinner; but Holdsworth hardly touched it. The
woman looked vexed as she removed it, for the neglect
of such a dainty was as good as a spoken disparagement
of her skill as a cook. She set a fine cheese, fresh from
the farmhouse over the way, upon the table, and butter
from the same dairy, firm and sweet-smelling, as butter
should be; but these were left untasted.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who he may be,” she whispered to
her husband, outside, “but if he don’t make a better
dinner than this every day, it’s no wonder his body’s a
shadder.”</p>

<p>The setting sunshine streamed into the little parlour
in which Holdsworth sat, and enriched the room with
its vivid crimson light; the soft evening breeze wafted
pleasant perfumes through the open window; and in
the air was the tender and delightful peace which falls
with an appreciable hush over little country villages,
where the sinking of the sun is the signal for rest.</p>

<p>Holdsworth had made up his mind to sleep in South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>bourne
that night. He needed the silence and the solitude
the little inn promised him, that he might meditate
upon the steps he should now take.</p>

<p>The feverish misery that had been born in him by
the landlady’s story was, in some measure, tranquillised,
and he had now the power, at least, to think with
tolerable clearness. And yet he was sorely perplexed,
as he sat with his head resting on his hand and his
weary eyes fixed on the little garden outside. Impulses
were governing him that made his mind incline from
side to side like a pendulum. Had Mr. Newcome been
alive&mdash;the kind and good old rector, whom he recalled
with love&mdash;he would have gone to him, avowed himself,
and entreated his counsel.</p>

<p>He felt that Dolly was dead to him. He felt this,
though no words that he had at his command would
have enabled him to explain his ideas. His own grand
sense of honour witnessed this truth, that she had
married another man in full belief that he&mdash;John Holdsworth&mdash;was
dead; and he recognised and appreciated
the force of the overwhelming claims of the moral obligation
imposed on him to leave her belief undisturbed.
Why? Because its disturbance would generate a heavy
burden of shame, would make her practically false to
both men, and stain her nature with a sin whose hue
would not be the less dark in the sight of the world
because her conscience had no share in it.</p>

<p>Such instinctive perception of the high needs of the
seldom-paralleled situation his fate had placed him in,
could only have possessed a man of deep honour, great
humanity, and rare unselfishness.</p>

<p>But his child!</p>

<p>The child of his own passionate love for Dolly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
<i>There</i> was the magnetic power that drew all his inclinations
away from the silent command of honour.</p>

<p>To see her&mdash;to behold himself renewed in a sweet
child’s face&mdash;to press his lips <i>once</i> to her cheek&mdash;once
only, if nevermore!</p>

<p>Oh! not once&mdash;not once only! To dwell near her,
to have her in his sight, to watch them both, and live
out the years that should be allotted him in secret contemplation
of the joy, the sacred pleasures, the divine
emotions embodied in this woman and her babe; happinesses
which had been broken away from his life&mdash;could
not this be?</p>

<p>He started up and looked at himself in the glass over
the mantel-shelf. Had suffering wrought in his face to
such poor purpose, that even the eye of love could pierce
through the sunken mask? His child knew him not&mdash;and
Dolly, deeming him dead, and holding him a thing
of the irreclaimable past, could not behold&mdash;could never
imagine that she beheld&mdash;in that bowed figure, that
bearded face, those hollow eyes, that hair with patches
of gray all over it, the handsome, vigorous, upright,
clear-eyed man whom she had called husband.</p>

<p>Husband! ... and she had left him.</p>

<p>Stop! Passages of the landlady’s story echoed in
his ears; how the poor young lady was starving; how
she had a tiny baby to support; how the workhouse
seemed better to her than the hopeless, scanty produce
of the needle; how she held back, reluctant to give her
hand to the man who wished to marry her; how she
had wept when her hand was given!</p>

<p>Oh, husband! oh, lover! though to the past only
those titles now belong; by your own sufferings, remember
hers! By your own misery, when, feeling yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
dying alone on the great deep, your physical torments
yielded to the fiercer tortures of your heart when you
thought of your wife praying for him, whom, you said
to yourself, she shall never see again, remember her!
pity her! Was his imagination so poor that he could
not find it in him to make, out of the landlady’s brief
tale, a pregnant, bitter picture of his wife’s trials? Not
so! To such a heart as his, one hint of misery would
bring with it many piteous details. There was infinite
anguish in the picture his fancy drew; but he forced
himself to contemplate it, that the jealousy, the disappointment,
the despair of unfulfilled hope, might melt
out of his heart, and leave it a fit shrine for the consecration
of the two images which the uncontrollable will
of his humanity as a father and a husband declared
should be placed there.</p>

<p>His fingers had stolen over his face as he stood
before the looking-glass. A long time he thus remained,
while the sun went down behind the trees in the far-off
fields, and the twilight stole softly into the room and
made his figure visionary. When he withdrew his
hands from his eyes, they were wet; but the one star
shining clearly in the dark blue overhead had dawned
out of the light to witness a fairer sight than the sun
had shone upon&mdash;a face from which all vestige of hardness
and severity had passed, eyes heavy with tears upturned
to God’s kingdom, and lips whispering a prayer
for help, for courage, for counsel, to aid the resolution
of his heart, intent upon a noble self-sacrifice that should
yet not remove it from the sphere of all that it held
dearest on earth.</p>

<span class="smaller">HANWITCH.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Hanwitch is nowhere seen to greater advantage than
from the summit of the little hill that flanks it on the
west. Here, if you are an epicure in your enjoyment
of what is picturesque in scenery, you will take your
stand at sunset, while the splendour still flushes the
heavens, and the country all around is tinted with a
delicate crimson haze. In this fairy light, Hanwitch,
from where you stand, will resemble some architectural
dream; for the serene sky gives an ideality to the proportions
which are magnified by the soft combining
shadows, and peace broods in the streets. The noble
church dedicated to St. James towers in the midst of
the houses; its spire glows with the red fire, which a
little while before had bathed the whole pile and kindled
brilliant stars in its long and narrow windows; and all
about the church rise and fall the roofs of closely-grouped
houses, manifold in colour, with lines of thin blue smoke
mounting straight into the sky. The town lies backed
with wooded scenery, and the picturesque outlines of
the houses take a new detail of beauty from the relief
they give to the soft dark masses of trees and lightlier-coloured
fields which make up the farther landscape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
And as you watch, a human interest will be communicated
to the town by the breaking out here and there of
little yellow lights. Darkness soon falls when the
crimson flush pales upon the sky; but where you stand
daylight is still around, mellowed into deepest, richest,
beauty of colour, and so lingering ere it fades into the
gray and gloom of twilight.</p>

<p>The town has been enlarged since the days to which
this story belongs; but elderly people are living whose
love for the old High Street scarcely reconciles them to
the “improvements” which have been made in its aspect.
Surveyors and local boards press sorely upon gentle
prejudices. These elderly people remember the row of
antique houses where the big bank building now stands.
They remember certain primitive shops, the windows
of which were furnished with diamond-shaped panes of
glass that discoloured to the eye the wares exposed for
sale within. They remember the picturesque alley out
of the High Street, with a cottage at the end of it that
had a green porch; it looked from its cool retreat upon
the narrow slice of the main thoroughfare with its passengers
flitting like shadows past the brief opening.
And I myself can recall the wonderful effect of light
and shadow in that tranquil embrasure when the evenings
lengthened, and as I beheld it once&mdash;a maid-servant,
picturesquely attired in a red petticoat, lolling within
the porch, her hand upon her hips, laughing at a dog
that stood on its hind legs begging; the figures
shadowed, the windows above burning with the light of
the setting sun, the pavement a deep gray.</p>

<p>In Holdsworth’s time, the vehicles and passengers
were in perfect keeping with the venerable and faded
but dignified aspect of the old street. The townspeople<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
still lingered behind the transition-epoch of that bygone
day, and held for the most part tenaciously to the costumes
and the indolence of their fathers.</p>

<p>The town was about an hour’s walk from Southbourne.
After quitting the handful of houses which
formed the village, Hanwitch came upon you as a metropolis.
To describe it in homely guide-book fashion:&mdash;It
had two good churches, and a public square full of
evergreens, rock-work, and stone images; several snug
inns, one wide street and a quantity of narrow ones; a
town-hall, a market-place, a prison, and a town-crier;
a large number of old ladies and fat poodles, invalids,
sedan-chairs, and camp-stools. In olden times&mdash;and
now I am talking of the eighteenth century&mdash;it had
held some sort of position as a third-rate inland watering-place;
but what had become of the springs which
had brought the gout, the vapours, and the spleen from
places as distant as London to drink, the oldest inhabitant
never could remember. But one thing was certain:
there was no lack of water in the place. A river ran
close to it, and from this river meandered some crystal
streamlets which ran right into the town. And where
the river was, the scenery was exquisite in summer&mdash;cool,
deep, and leafy, with a bridge at each end of the town,
a little landing-stage, a punt or two, and midway between
the bridges, a cluster of trees on either bank,
with huge gnarled trunks and roots which ran naked
for many feet along the ground, whilst, high above,
their branches mingled and formed a tunnel for the
water to flow under. Here the trout would leap; here
the water-rat would sneak from its earthy chamber and
break the tide into thin ripples as it noiselessly made
for the opposite shore; here the sunshine would fall in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
threads through the leaves and gild the black long-legged
insects on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Ten o’clock was striking when Holdsworth was
driven into Hanwitch by the landlord of the Southbourne
inn, who was rich enough to own a horse and
gig. The drive had been a very short one, and in the
landlord’s opinion seven-and-sixpence had never been
more easily earned. The gig was stopped at the door
of the “Hanwitch Arms,” and Holdsworth got out.
Then came a porter, who nodded pleasantly to the
owner of the gig, and hoisted the portmanteau on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“My respecks to the governor, Joe. How is he?”</p>

<p>“Pretty middlin’! How’s yourself?”</p>

<p>“Why, I can’t say as I’m quite the thing. The
weather’s been rayther agin my rheumatiz.&mdash;Wish you
good mornin’, sir.”</p>

<p>And with this farewell to Holdsworth, the landlord
drove himself away.</p>

<p>Holdsworth’s plans had been fully settled by him the
night before; and one part of them was that he should
put up at some inn at Hanwitch, while he made inquiries
of deep interest to himself, and obtained a lodging.
Having followed the porter into the bar and ordered a
bed for the night, he re-entered the street.</p>

<p>His emotions, as he first began to walk, were conflicting
and painful. He was now in the town where
his wife lived; any moment might bring them face to
face, and the wildest anxiety to see her was mixed up
with a sensation of shrinking fear of the encounter. He
stared eagerly at the people, and now and again, when
a little child passed, his heart beat rapidly, and he felt
his blood leave his face. But he mastered himself soon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
repeatedly muttering, as a reassuring argument, that,
were they to meet, Dolly would not know him.</p>

<p>He was in the main street, walking slowly, and
helping his step with a stick, not more from habit than
from necessity, for he was frequently seized with a weakness
in the legs which would sometimes oblige him to
stop, or seat himself if a seat were at hand. His object
now was to find out where Dolly lived, a question he
would not ask the landlady at Southbourne, lest, added
to the inquiries he had already made, it should excite
her suspicion and set her surmising.</p>

<p>He noticed a small chemist’s shop opposite, and, his
mind establishing a friendly connection between drugs
and dentistry, he crossed and entered. A bald-headed
man in spectacles received him with a bow.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me where Mr. Conway, the dentist,
lives?”</p>

<p>The chemist, who knew perfectly well, scratched his
ear and seemed to reflect. He drew teeth himself, and
was not disposed to furnish a rival with a patient if he
could help it.</p>

<p>“I know the name, sir, and&mdash;&mdash;might I ask if you
want anything done to your teeth.”</p>

<p>“No, I merely wish to know where Mr. Conway lives.”</p>

<p>“It’s not for me to speak ill of a brother practitioner,
and as I shan’t mention names, no harm can be done,”
said the chemist, with his eye on Holdsworth’s mouth;
“but I do say that it’s a pity people should start in a
business, requiring as much skill as the highest branches
of surgery, without knowing the difference between an
eye and a wisdom tooth, and drinking to that degree
that their hands tremble like the windows of a coach in
full tear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does Mr. Conway drink?”</p>

<p>“I name no names,” replied the chemist, assuming
an injured expression of face. “I should be sorry to
take away any man’s character, not to speak of the
bread out of his mouth, though there are some people
not quite so particular as me in that matter, and will
start lies which should make ’em afraid to go to bed.
All that I say is, that if I had a toothache, and wanted
to get my jaw broke and my gum tore out, I’d go to a
certain person livin’ not a day’s walk from this shop,
and ask him to look at my tooth.”</p>

<p>Saying which he nodded vigorously, and, taking up
a bottle, began to mould a piece of blue paper over the
cork.</p>

<p>“Where does this Mr. Conway live?” inquired Holdsworth,
who judged that there might be a good deal
more of professional animus than truth in the chemist’s
observations.</p>

<p>“I believe,” replied the chemist, sulkily vouchsafing
the information which he could scarcely longer evade,
“that the party you refer to lives in the Ellesmere Road.
He did yesterday; but some persons in this world are
so dependent on their landlords that there’s no tellin’
what’s going to happen to ’em to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Thanking this very good-natured and remarkably
ingenuous chemist for his direction, Holdsworth quitted
the shop and walked up the street. He asked a butcher-boy
the way to Ellesmere Road, and was told to keep
straight on, until he came to a “Methody’s Chapel, ven
he’d see a turnin’, vich ’ud be the road he ast for.”</p>

<p>The Methodist Chapel was a good distance off, and
as Holdsworth’s pace was slow, he had plenty of leisure
for reflection, which was bitter enough; for, strive as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
he might to waive the chemist’s gossip as mere trade
scandal and jealousy, his mind persisted in fastening on
it, and turning it about, and coining deep anxiety out
of it.</p>

<p>If this Mr. Conway <i>were</i> the drunkard the chemist
affirmed him to be, and the pauper too&mdash;for the sarcasm
about “persons being dependent on their landlords” had
not been lost&mdash;what kind of life was Dolly and <i>his</i> child
leading? He frowned, and felt his hand tighten on the
handle of his stick; but a milder persuasion grew in
him, and he forced his mind away from the subject.</p>

<p>So bright a morning as it was would bring forth many
people; and the High Street was tolerably well filled
with pedestrians, and old people in bath-chairs, wheeled
along the gutters for fear of the horses, and nurses
dragging children by the hand, and waggons, and tradesmen’s
traps. The early coach from Canterbury came
thundering along the street, the guard blowing his horn
and causing house-windows to fly open, and heads to
protrude, and a handkerchief, or, maybe, a duster here
and there, to be waved in coy recognition of the hand-kissing
of certain spruce and finely-attired gentlemen
on the top of the vehicle.</p>

<p>But, varied and cheerful as the scene was, Holdsworth
had no eyes but for the women and children he
met, at whom he darted quick eager glances, which must
have sent some of the women tripping along with a
sincere conviction that they had met with one admirer,
at all events, that morning.</p>

<p>He passed the market-place with its stalls loaded
with garden produce, and clean little shops submitting
a tempting array of plump fowls, geese, sides of bacon,
legs of pork, and strings of sausages; and in about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
twenty minutes’ time reached the Methodist Chapel,
and turned into the Ellesmere Road.</p>

<p>A short broad road, with the sun-lighted country beyond;
on either side, small newly-built villas, with now
and again a house presenting a more venerable aspect.
There was grass in the roadway, and one or two of the
villas had placards in their windows. In the front
garden of one of the nearer houses an old gentleman,
with an inflamed face, and a white hankerchief over his
head, was plying a rake. No other person was visible;
but, when Holdsworth had advanced a few steps, a
woman came out of a gate and approached him. His
heart came into his throat, and he stood stock still. She
drew near, but she was not Dolly. She glanced at him
as she passed, struck, maybe, by his pale face, and the
singular mixture of old age and youth which his appearance
and figure suggested.</p>

<p>He breathed deeply and walked forward, glancing to
right and left of him.</p>

<p>The last house but one on the left was the house he
wanted. A brass plate inscribed with Conway’s name
and calling was fixed to the iron railings, and over the
door was a lamp furnished with blue and red glass.</p>

<p>Holdsworth dared scarcely glance at it. When his
eye encountered the name he turned cold, and felt the
damp perspiration suffusing his forehead.</p>

<p>He came back hurriedly, with the bare impression on
his mind of a small house with the upper blinds drawn,
and with an untended garden in the front.</p>

<p>He returned to the main entrance of the road, stopped,
looked back, and then slowly retraced his steps.</p>

<p>There was a house of an older fashion than any of
the others on the right-hand side, about midway; one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
that had evidently taken root there many years before
the little villas had gathered themselves together to
intercept its view and violate its pastoral solitude. Its
doorway was sheltered by a roomy porch, with creepers
clambering up its trellised supporters; its darkling windows
had the burnished glitter upon them that is peculiar
to old glass; its eaves were capacious enough to accommodate
a whole colony of swallows, and it had a fair
piece of ground stretching away at its back. The bright
brass knocker on the green door, the white doorsteps,
the purity of the window glass, and the spotlessness of
the window drapery, afforded an excellent guarantee
of the housewifely qualities of the inmates. In one of
the windows hung a card. Holdsworth opened the gate
and knocked.</p>

<p>“I should like to see your apartments,” he said to
the cheerful-faced, middle-aged woman who had promptly
replied to his summons.</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir; please to walk in.”</p>

<p>She threw open the door of a long sitting-room, smelling
of lavender and mignonette, and furnished with worked
chairs, old china, a tall wooden clock with a febrile tick,
a hearth-rug decorated with blue and yellow roses in
wool, and a sour squeezed-looking bookcase which
seemed to hold sundry folios under protest, and to
threaten the instant ejection of a number of small books
on the top shelves, which leaned one against another,
some of them gaping apparently in the last extremity of
terror.</p>

<p>“For yourself, sir? Or might there be children?”</p>

<p>“For myself.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, sir,” exclaimed the woman, with great
alacrity, “I think I can accommodate you. You can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
have this room, and a bed-room just over it, and the use
of the pianner in the next room when you see company,
for fourteen shillings a week.”</p>

<p>“That will do,” said Holdsworth.</p>

<p>The woman, smiling like clockwork, proceeded to inform
him that she was a widow, and had nobody else in
the house but her mother, who was very aged and silly-like,
and only left her room, which was upstairs, once a
week for a turn in the garden; that anything more
peaceful than her house was never known, and that if
the gentleman was studious, he would never be interrupted
with noises.</p>

<p>She then led him upstairs to the bedroom, which was
as comfortable as any man could wish.</p>

<p>On their return to the sitting-room, Holdsworth, who
was tired, asked permission to rest himself, and sat down
near the window which overlooked the road, where he
could just obtain a glimpse of Mr. Conway’s house.</p>

<p>He broke away from the overpowering thoughts
which the sense of the near presence of his wife and
child forced upon him, and steadying his voice, turned
to the woman who stood at the door, and asked her if
she knew any of the people living around.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, I know most of my neighbours by name,
though I can’t say as e’er a one of ’em are friends of
mine.”</p>

<p>“I noticed a dentist’s house just now, over the way.
What sort of business can he do in such a road as this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re speaking of Mr. Conway!” she exclaimed,
with a shake of the head. “It’s his own fault if he
don’t do a good business, for I hear that he’s pretty
clever at making teeth and drawing of them, and the
likes of that; but he don’t seem to have no patients,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and I know why; but it’s not for me to meddle in other
folks’ concerns.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re no friend of his, sir?” she said.</p>

<p>“I never saw the gentleman in my life.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, to speak plainly, he drinks; and it’s
pretty well known; and so there’s no wonder gentlefolks
won’t go near him.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth forced a look of unconcern into his face
as he asked:</p>

<p>“Is he married?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir; and a sweet dear creature his wife is;
Mrs. Holdsworth as was. Hers is a sad history. She
lived at a place called Southbourne&mdash;maybe you know
it&mdash;it’s an hour’s walk from here; and I was told her
story by Mrs. Campion, as used to keep a greengrocer’s
shop in that village, and served most of the gentry
about. She&mdash;I’m speaking of Mrs. Conway&mdash;lost her
husband at sea, and married the present gentleman two
or three years afterwards. Mrs. Campion said she was
driven to it by want o’ the bare necessaries of life,”
added the woman in a subdued voice.</p>

<p>Holdsworth was silent.</p>

<p>“I don’t think,” continued the woman, “that she
leads a very happy life. We sometimes has a chat together
when we meet out o’ doors, and she’s the civilest,
sweetest young thing I ever knew. But,” she exclaimed,
catching herself up, “all this is no business of mine;
and I hope, sir, you’ll think none the worse of me for
gossiping about strangers’ affairs. I was strivin’ to
answer your questions, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Holdsworth, rising, but keeping his
back to the window. “Can you receive me to-morrow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir; at any time you’re pleased to come.”</p>

<p>“My name is Hampden. I shall sleep to-night at
the ‘Hanwitch Arms.’ Here are a couple of sovereigns,
which will serve you as a security for my taking your
rooms. I leave myself in your hands, and have no
doubt I shall be comfortable.”</p>

<p>The woman took the money with a courtesy, thinking
to herself that she had never met with a more polite
and considerate gentleman. Holdsworth left the house.
He cast a swift glance at the villa with the plate upon
the railing, and then hurried towards the town.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN THE ELLESMERE ROAD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Holdsworth spent the greater part of the evening in
writing a letter to Mr. Sherman. At twelve o’clock
next day he was an inmate of Mrs. Parrot’s house in
the Ellesmere Road.</p>

<p>In his walk to the lodgings he had met only strange
faces, one or two of which looked after him, struck,
perhaps, by his keen fugitive glance, his slow pace that
stole along the ground, and his depressed head, as
though there were a shame in his heart that made the
daylight painful.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot fussed about him for some time, and
tired him with an account of the articles she had purchased
for him. Her memory was slow, and her capacity
of reckoning very indifferent; hence it took her
twenty minutes to account for the expenditure of twelve
shillings. Happily, it was her mother’s day for walking
in the garden, and Holdsworth could see the old lady&mdash;a
mere wisp of a figure, in ancient black satin reaching
to her ankles and clinging to her legs, a nose like the
Duke of Wellington’s, and a chin like Punch’s&mdash;hobbling
along a gravel walk, looking with afflicting agitation
around her, and coughing like a rattle, as a signal to
her daughter, who, when she had done with her
accounts, hurried out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>The control Holdsworth had kept upon himself,
while Mrs. Parrot remained in the room, he could now
put aside; indeed, the suffering caused him by his pent-up
agitation imperatively demanded that the emotion
should have play. Now he would walk hastily to and
fro the room, and then fling himself into a chair, clasping
his hands tightly, and then rise and stand before
the window and send glances passionate and shrinking
at the house occupied by the Conways.</p>

<p>Now that he was close to his wife, now that any
moment might reveal her walking past his window with
his child, perchance, at her side, he dreaded lest the unparalleled
situation he had forced himself into would prove
too heavily charged with cruel conditions for him to
bear. Never once then, never once afterwards, did the
vaguest impulse possess him to go forth and declare
himself and claim her. No! A sense of honour that
was inexorable, since it prohibited the faintest echo of
the soul’s secret passionate yearning to make itself
audible, had decreed his silence and enforced the obedience
of inclination.</p>

<p>The only concession granted was the enjoyment of
such ghostly and barren pleasure as his heart could find
in the knowledge of the close neighbourhood of the two
who were so dear to him. Oh! bitter waking of memory,
to recall him from the sunny vision of the old times
when his joy was complete, and love a permanent possession
to enrich his nature with all gracious and generous
emotions, to thrust him into the gray and bleak twilight
of a loveless and desolate life, which the recovered power
could only embitter by recurrence to the things that
were lost!</p>

<p>His eyes wandered ceaselessly and restlessly towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the window. From time to time people went by with
the slow, aimless step of persons who walk for no other
end than exercise. An old gentleman, with a white
moustache and a dark skin, stopped, with another old
gentleman, in high shirt-collars and a tail-coat, opposite
Holdsworth’s window, and argued, with many galvanic
flourishes of the arms and grimaces of the face. There
was much political excitement abroad at that time, owing
to the Reform Bill of the Grey Administration, to which
the royal assent had been given; and the dark-skinned
old gentleman&mdash;whose age, warmth, and intemperate
flourishes were as demonstrative of his politics as his
language&mdash;bade his companion take notice that, before
five years were passed, England would be a tenth-rate
power, governed by a mob, with a Jesuit seated on every
hearth, a Nuncio preaching at St. Paul’s, not a Bible to
be found in the country, and the gallows groaning under
strings of honest patriots. The old gentleman in the
high shirt-collars, who clearly shared his friend’s opinions,
nodded savagely, asked with his shoulders, “What would
you have?” and then moved on a dozen paces, to be
stopped again by the other old gentleman with prophecies,
maybe, more blood-chilling and awful than those
he had already declaimed.</p>

<p>Presently Holdsworth, scarcely conscious of what he
was about, left the window and approached the bookcase.
He pulled out a volume, which proved to be an
old copy of Gulliver’s Travels, “adorn’d with sculptures;”
and his eye lighting on that passage in which
Gulliver closes his account of his second voyage,<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> his
thoughts trooped off to his old sea-faring life, the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
closed upon his fingers, and he sank in deep meditation.</p>

<p>The restoration of his memory was comparatively so
recent, that he had found no leisure to recall those
frightful experiences of his which could not recur without
overwhelming him with an unspeakable horror of
the sea. He now understood that it should have been
his duty to call upon the owners of the “Meteor,” and
acquaint them with the circumstances of the wreck of
their vessel, and the deaths of the persons who were in
his boat, all whom he clearly remembered. There were
friends, doubtless, both in England and America, who
could wish to receive tidings of the fate of these people,
though the long interval of five years should tell as plain
a story as Holdsworth could relate. He knew not
whether the inmates of the other boats had been saved,
and he would have given much to ascertain this; but
he understood that any communication he made to the
shipowners would be almost sure to appear in print, by
which his wife would learn that he was alive. “No!
let the world think me dead!” he exclaimed bitterly.
He had only to live for the past now&mdash;for that memory
which had betrayed him and ruined his life. His future
was bare and barren, and there was nothing in all the
world that could kindle one ray of comfort in his hopeless
heart but the bleak privilege of dwelling near his
wife and child.</p>

<p>He restored the book to its place and returned to
the window.</p>

<p>In the roadway, a few yards to the right, a little girl
was standing, holding a doll. She was a very little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
creature, with bright yellow hair down her back, and
she held the doll in motherly fashion on her arm, and
caressed it with her hand.</p>

<p>Her back was towards Holdsworth, whose eyes were
rooted upon her.</p>

<p>She turned presently and looked down the road, and
Holdsworth saw a little face upon which God had graven
a sign that made the poor father clutch at the wall to
steady himself. For there was his own face in miniature&mdash;the
face that Dolly had loved before the sufferings of
the mind, and the anguish of hunger and thirst, had
twisted from it all resemblance it had ever borne to what
was manly and beautiful in the human countenance.</p>

<p>He pressed his hands to his eyes and gazed again,
then ran to the bell-rope and pulled it. But when he
had done this he wished it undone. For would not his
agitation excite Mrs. Parrot’s suspicions? What was
there in a stranger’s child that should so interest him?</p>

<p>He bit his lip and controlled himself with desperate
will; and, when Mrs. Parrot opened the door, he said to
her in a steady voice and with a forced smile:</p>

<p>“I am sorry to trouble you. I am very fond of
little children. Pray can you tell me who that child is,
there?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot drew to the window, evidently finding
nothing odd in the question, and said:</p>

<p>“Why, that’s little Nelly Holdsworth, Mrs. Conway’s
daughter.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“She <i>is</i> a dear!” continued Mrs. Parrot. “I am
very fond of that child, Mr. Hampden. She’s the only
child i’ the road I allow to come into my garden, for
children are so wilful, there’s no tellin’ what they’ll do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the moment your eyes are off ’em. See what a little
lady she looks, and how prettily she holds her doll!
She’s waiting for her mamma, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot rapped with her nails on the window.
The child looked round, and Holdsworth shrank away.
Mrs. Parrot beckoned. Holdsworth would have stopped
her, but could find no words.</p>

<p>“She’s coming, Mr. Hampden. I’ll bring her to you,
sir, if you’ll wait a moment.”</p>

<p>And out she went.</p>

<p>In a few seconds she returned, leading by the hand
the child, who hung back when she caught sight of the
white-faced, bearded man.</p>

<p>“There, Mr. Hampden, this is my pretty young
friend, little Nelly!” exclaimed Mrs. Parrot, stooping to
give the child a kiss. “Go and shake hands with the
gentleman, my dear, and show him your nice doll. I’ll
tell you when I see your mamma.”</p>

<p>“Come, dear, come to me,” said Holdsworth in a
low voice.</p>

<p>The child approached him slowly, stopping now and
again, and looking shyly at Mrs. Parrot.</p>

<p>“Tut! tut!” exclaimed that lady. “What are you
afraid of, Miss Nelly? Go and shake hands with the
gentleman, like a little lady.”</p>

<p>Holdsworth put out his hand; the child advanced a
step nearer; he fell upon one knee and drew her to
him.</p>

<p>For some moments he could not speak; he could
only look at her&mdash;look with eyes of all-devouring love
absorbing all the sweetness of that young face, feeling a
pang of exquisite joy, but shivering quickly as his fingers
locked themselves upon her tiny hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>He longed to press the little creature to his heart, to
fasten his lips upon her mouth, to weep over her.</p>

<p>“Tell me your name, little one!”</p>

<p>“Nelly,” replied the child, keeping at arm’s length
from him, and staring into his face.</p>

<p>“Nelly what?”</p>

<p>“Nelly Ho’dwor’t.”</p>

<p>His own name, thus lisped by her, thrilled through
him; he caught his breath, and said:</p>

<p>“May I kiss you?”</p>

<p>She put up her mouth, and he kissed her.</p>

<p>“How pretty your hair is!” he murmured, in a voice
of exquisite tenderness, which made Mrs. Parrot turn
suddenly and look at him. He met her glance with a
smile, and said:</p>

<p>“I am very fond of children. Will this little girl
come and see me here sometimes?”</p>

<p>“Ay, that she will, sir. Won’t you, Nelly?”</p>

<p>“Det.”</p>

<p>“How old are you, Nelly?”</p>

<p>“Four.”</p>

<p>“Who gave you that doll?”</p>

<p>“Mamma.”</p>

<p>“You will bring dolly to see me, and we will have
tea, all three of us. What have I got here? A bright
shilling! That will buy dolly a parasol!”</p>

<p>No words can describe the tone his voice took as
he spoke.</p>

<p>“What do you say to the gentleman for this beautiful
present?” cried Mrs. Parrot.</p>

<p>“Tanks,” said the child, putting the doll on the floor
to examine the money with both hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, here comes your mamma!” said Mrs. Parrot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
“Make your reverence to the gentleman ... there’s a
dear; pick up dolly ... that’s right.”</p>

<p>She took Nelly’s hand and ran with her out of the
room.</p>

<p>The mother, standing at her gate on the other side
of the road, looking up and down the road, caught sight
of Mrs. Parrot and the child, and crossed over to them.</p>

<p>They remained opposite Holdsworth’s window talking,
while he, shrinking against the wall, peered at them
through the muslin curtain.</p>

<p>The five years which had passed since he had seen
his wife had worked but a very little change in her.
There was more womanly fulness in her form; and this
was about all those five years had done for her. Her
face was still as youthful as when Holdsworth had last
looked on it, her eyes still possessed their deep and
delicate tint, the hair its richness and lustre, the mouth
its sweetness, the whole face that almost infantine expression,
conveyed by soft shadowy lines and the archness
of the pencilled eyebrows, which made it beautiful
in repose, more beautiful yet in sorrow. But, young
and fair as she seemed, there was a deep-rooted care in
her face which, without qualifying its freshness, yet
mingled in her smile, and lived in her eyes, and fixed a
wistful look on her, such as would be seen in one who
lingers long, long waiting for the summons to depart
which no day brings. Her dress was shabby, her gloves
old; but her beauty made even her faded apparel, cut
after the unbecoming fashion then in vogue, picturesque.
She wore a white crape handkerchief over her bare
shoulders, and a bonnet-shaped hat, ornamented with a
dark feather, which, drooping over her back, imparted
a peculiar vividness to the light, sheeny gold of her hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Strained as his ears were, Holdsworth could not hear
her voice, though Mrs. Parrot’s kindly cackle was audible
enough. It was manifest that they exchanged mere
commonplace civilities; and presently Mrs. Parrot
dropped a courtesy, and the mother and child walked
slowly away.</p>

<p>Holdsworth watched them with just such a look in
his eyes as had been in them when, racked with torture
in the open boat, he had cast glances full of passionate
despair round the horizon for the ship that was to rescue
him. He saw the little girl hold up her shilling, whereupon
the mother stopped and looked back, then continued
her walk and passed out of sight.</p>

<span class="smaller">OVER THE WAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was natural, after the first liveliness of the emotion
which had been excited in Mrs. Parrot’s breast by the
installation of a lodger worth fourteen shillings a week
to her, had in some degree subsided, that she should
begin to wonder who that lodger was.</p>

<p>She had been particularly struck and greatly taken
by his behaviour to the little girl, and inferred, of
course, that he was a humane and tender-hearted man,
a conjecture which, although it was true, did no credit
to her sagacity, considering the circumstance on which
it was based; since it is a notorious fact, that great
rascals will admire, pet, and “tip” little children, whose
parents they would not scruple to rob of their very
last farthing.</p>

<p>But though Mrs. Parrot had no doubt as to her
lodger’s humanity of character after what she had seen,
she could not by any means feel so sure as to the
position he held either in or out of society, the calling
he had followed, if ever he <i>had</i> followed a calling, or the
part of the world he came from. His name was Hampden.
That was English. But had he a Christian name? No
initial stood between the Mr. and the Hampden, on the
card affixed to his portmanteau. <i>Was</i> he a Christian?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
She hoped he was. She was no judge of other religions;
but she must say, when she let her lodgings to people,
that she liked to <i>feel</i> that they were Christians.</p>

<p>He had ordered dinner at two o’clock; and when
she came in to lay the cloth, for she kept no servant,
she found him still at the window, staring into the
empty road as earnestly as if it were filled with a very
beautiful and novel procession. But she could only
suppose that he looked out of the window because he
was new to the place.</p>

<p>He smiled softly when he met her glance, but did
not speak, nor would she hazard any remarks herself,
for fear of being thought intrusive. All that he said
during dinner was to express himself well pleased with
her cooking; but she noticed, in removing the dishes,
that, pleasantly as he had praised the piece of roast
mutton, he had scarcely tasted it, and that of the four
potatoes she had put into the dish, three and a half
remained.</p>

<p>Whilst in the kitchen she heard him leave the house,
and, when her task was done, she went upstairs to her
mother’s room, whither she had conducted the old lady
soon after little Nelly’s visit.</p>

<p>“If the gentleman don’t eat more every day than
he’s just had for dinner,” said she, throwing herself back
in a chair and fanning her hot face with the corner of
her apron, “I reckon we shall have a funeral here
before long.”</p>

<p>“A what!” gasped the old woman, who sat upright
in a cane chair, near the open window, with an
immense Bible on her right hand and her spectacles on
the top of it.</p>

<p>“He’s no more than skin an’ bone as he is,” con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>tinued
Mrs. Parrot, “but it was a picter to see him
with the child. I never see a man more soft with a
child before.”</p>

<p>“He ain’t likely to make strange nises o’ nights, is
he, Sairey?” exclaimed the old woman, earnestly regarding
her daughter with a pair of eyes from which all
expression and light seemed literally washed out, leaving
nothing but two circles of weak, dim blue.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. He seems to me quiet enough.
He’s fond o’ staring into the road. One might think
he’s trying to find out where he is. I niver see a
stranger face. He don’t look English-like, and yet he
talks uncommon well. I can tell by his boots&mdash;which
is square as square at the toes, and his clothes, which
have an odd twist somehows&mdash;that he’s not from these
parts. Maybe, he’s from Ireland.”</p>

<p>“I hope not, Sairey,” ejaculated the old woman,
bending forward with the profoundly confidential air of
old age. “I was once fellow-sarvint with a Ayrish
futman as was allus talkin’ of burnin’ down houses, an’
his speech ran on so it were niver to be trusted, for
niver was such lies as he used to tell. You’d best gi’
him notice, Sairey. You can say I gi’ yer more trouble
nor you can well get through, and recommend Burton’s
lodgin’s to him. Burton’s a strong man, and kapes
dogs.”</p>

<p>“Tut! I’m not afeard!” said Mrs. Parrot, tossing
up her hands and giving her cap a pull. “There’s no
more harm in the man than there is in you, for didn’t
I tell yer how he gave the girl a shillin’ and spoke that
soft to it, it made me feel as if I could ha’ cried. Give
him notice, and him not here a day yit! Fourteen
shillin’ is fourteen shillin’ in these scarce times, to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
nothin’ of his being as well-spoken a man as iver you
listened to in your life; an’ as for his face, it is but as
God made it, an’ beauty is but skin deep, as t’ parson
says, an’ I’m for lettin’ well alone.”</p>

<p>“If he ain’t Ayrish,” said the old woman, stroking
the back of her lean hand, “he may be very well. But
sitch talk of invasions from that nashun as I used to
hear when I was a gal, an’ the drink an’ shootin’ as goes
on there, is enough to wet your hair with perspiration ...”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> didn’t say he was Irish. <i>I</i> don’t know what he
is. He was askin’ about Mrs. Conway, though she’s
unbeknown to him, as any one might tell who heerd
him questionin’. He wants Miss Nelly to bear him
company at tea, and I don’t see why the child can’t
come, if the mother ’ull let it. I won’t take it upon
myself to bring the child in. I’ll speak to the mother
when I see her. I like Mrs. Conway. She’s a nice-spoken
lady, but seems to know a deal of grief, poor
thing. It ’ud be a mussy if that husband of hers ’ud
take it into his head to pull out all his own teeth. The
cook at Mrs. Short’s was tellin’ me he’s grown that
wicious there’s no wishin’ him a civil good mornin’. An’
drink! Didn’t I see him pass here yesterday evenin’,
staggerin’ on his legs like a doll which a child tries to
teach walkin’ to?”</p>

<p>“The ’pothecaries used to draw teeth in my day;
now they must be all gentlefolks as looks into your
mouth,” said the old woman, who had been three minutes
searching in her pocket for the snuff-box that lay open,
with some of its sand-coloured contents spilt, in her
lap.</p>

<p>“Pretty gentlefolks!” exclaimed Mrs. Parrot, pull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>ing
up the old woman’s dress and tilting the spilt snuff
into the box. “If they’re all like Mr. Conway, I’d rather
carry a toothache to my grave than have it stopped wi’
the lockjaw, which they tell me he gave to Mr. Timpson;
for drink had taken away the use of his mind, and he
pushed the wrong instrayment into the man’s mouth
and nearly choked him, he did, and then took out two
wrong teeth after all; beautiful teeth they was, for Mr.
Timpson showed them to me hisself, with the tears
standin’ in his eyes, wropped up in silver paper.”</p>

<p>“Thank God! he can’t draw none o’ my teeth!”
mumbled the old woman, talking through her nose in
rapt enjoyment of the flavour of the snuff. “They’re
all gone.”</p>

<p>“I noticed Mrs. Conway’s gownd to-day. If I was
her husband, I’d scorn to let her appear in sitch a rag.
And there was darns in the knees o’ that child’s stockings
as made ’em look forty year old. They’re always
i’ the same dresses, both of ’em. There’s a silk she puts
on o’ Sundays, all wore thin over the buzzum, and I
remember the bonnet she had on to-day iver since I’ve
known her. Sitch a pretty face as she has, too! I expect
he must ha’ told her some fine lies to get her to
marry him. They say he niver did well, even when he
was in the High Street, wi’ that show-box of his stuck
up, filled wi’ gaping gums an’ naked teeth as turned the
stomach to see. He must ha’ sold that piece of ugliness,
for I don’t see it nowheres outside his house, which is a
mussy, for I’d as lief see a skiliton on a pole for a sign!
Fancy a doctor settin’ up a death’s-head to show his
trade!”</p>

<p>She jumped from her chair with a face and gesture
of disgust, and throwing some knitting with the pins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
through it into her mother’s lap, adjusted her cap before
the glass, and left the room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is always some truth in gossip: and there was
a great deal in what Mrs. Parrot had said of Mr. Conway,
who, as we have seen, held no place at all in her
opinion. But then sympathy for Dolly was to be expected
from a woman who, if she did not know what it
was to live with a drunkard, had known what it was to
live with a surly man, whose eye was evil, and whose
voice was thick, and whose characteristic method of expressing
discontent was by holding his clenched fist
under his wife’s nose.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway is passing Mrs. Parrot’s door at the very
moment that Mrs. Parrot is leaving her mother’s bedroom;
we shall not have an opportunity of seeing much
of him, having the fortunes of a better kind of hero to
deal with; so, while Holdsworth is away from his lodgings,
we’ll step into the road and have a look at the
dentist, and follow him into his house.</p>

<p>He is a man with sandy whiskers and light hair, but
by no means ill-looking. On the contrary, there are
materials in his face out of which a very pleasing countenance
could be made; a well-shaped nose, a well-shaped
forehead, a good chin, a facial outline clearly defined and
perfectly symmetrical.</p>

<p>But there never was a better illustration than this
man’s face of the truth, that good features make but a
very small portion of beauty.</p>

<p>I want a word to express that middle quality of
aspect which is contrived by the mingling of comely
lineaments with bad passions. Possibly the effect is no
more than a neutralisation of nature’s good intentions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
wherein we behold a handsome countenance sunk into
a species of physical negation, by moral qualities tugging
it hard in the direction of repellent ugliness.</p>

<p>A most unstriking face at which you would barely
glance, and pass on absolutely unimpressed. His thin
lips might mark both cruelty and selfishness; his eyes
are made heavy by their drooping lids, and the irids
are pale and unintelligent. He is dressed in the style
of the times, of course; pantaloons strapped over his
boots, a frock-coat gaping in a circle round a great
quantity of black satin stock (in which are two pins and
a chain). But the pantaloons are frayed at the heels
and bagged at the knees; and the coat is suspiciously
polished at the elbows and the rim of the collar. He
walks with a quick, uneasy step, his hat slightly cocked,
and his hands in his breeches pockets, and arriving at
the gate of his house, opens it by giving it a kick with
his foot.</p>

<p>He entered the sitting-room with his hat on, and
found the cloth laid for dinner, but nobody in the room,
which was a soiled and dingy apartment, although the
house was a new one, and the paper fresh and the ceiling
white. But no paper and whitewash could qualify
the sordid suggestions of the old drugget imperfectly
nailed over the floor, the old leather sofa and the old
leather arm-chair, the mantelpiece decorated by a pair
of plated candlesticks marked with indents, the dingy
red curtains, the <i>papier mâché</i> table in the window, with
the mother-of-pearl dropping out of it.</p>

<p>The subtle magic of feminine fingers which extracts
from rubbish itself what hidden capabilities it may possess
of comforting the eye with some faintest aspect of
taste, seemed either never to have been exercised upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
this room, or to have found itself powerless to deal with
it. The only feminine sign was a small bundle of
child’s stockings on the top of an old work-basket on
the sofa.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway put his head out of the door and called,
“Are you there, wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Dolly’s voice from downstairs.</p>

<p>“How long will dinner be?”</p>

<p>“Five minutes!”</p>

<p>He threw his hat down and walked into the “surgery,”
a room at the end of the passage, furnished with
a chest of drawers, a toilet-table and a looking-glass, an
arm-chair, an ugly circular box with a basin let into it,
standing beside the arm-chair; on the toilet-table, some
small hand-glasses, a pair of forceps, and three unfinished
false teeth. Through the window was to be seen a slip
of garden of the breadth of the house, and about fifty
feet long&mdash;its neglected state, its few pining shrubs, and
a flag-pole with a vane a-top that croaked to every passage
of the wind, showing up very squalidly against the
neighbouring garden, which was richly stocked with
wall-fruit and ferns and green plants.</p>

<p>Little Nelly was in this piece of ground with her
doll, seated on the grass, and at that moment making
such a picture as a painter would stop to study and receive
into his mind; her round dark-blue eyes following
the swallows which chased each other high in the air,
her mouth pouted into an expression of exquisite infantine
wonder, her bright hair about her shoulders, and looking,
as the breeze stirred the sunshine upon it, like a falling
shower of fine gold.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway stared at the child for a moment, and
then turned away and sauntered towards the door, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
came back to open one of the drawers in the chest and
extract a leather-covered bottle, which he shook at his
ear, and put to his mouth.</p>

<p>O God! what contrasts there are in life, lying so
close together that the devil, though his worship be no
bigger than a man, might measure the space between
with outstretched hands! Look at Purity and Innocence
in the garden, with its eyes raised to heaven; and the
skulking fellow in the dingy room swallowing brandy as
a man steals money; and in the room below&mdash;a darksome,
scantily-furnished kitchen&mdash;a sweet-faced woman doing
servant’s work, and urging the slattern by her side into
quicker movements, that the gentleman upstairs shall
have no occasion to use bad language.</p>

<p>She comes upstairs presently, this Dolly, her face
flushed, and breathing quickly from the hurry of her
movements, and bears with her own hands a dish that
will furnish but a poor repast, though she has done her
best to make what little there is palatable. The slattern,
with wisps of red hair about her forehead, and loose
shoes, which beat a double knock at each step upon the
uncarpeted staircase, follows, armed with a jug and a
loaf of bread. Behind comes little Nelly, whom the
mother has summoned before leaving the kitchen, and
who has climbed the staircase with more labour than
Mont Blanc is scaled by the Alpine tourist.</p>

<p>No word is spoken. Nelly is lifted into a chair by
her mother, and Mr. Conway seats himself before the
dish and fills a glass from the jug of ale, taking care&mdash;a
true connoisseur in such matters&mdash;to let the liquor fall
from a height, to secure a froth, into which he dips his
mouth and nose.</p>

<p>The slattern leaves the room; and Dolly cuts up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
some meat and bread for the little one, with a whisper
in her ear to say grace.</p>

<p>“Did you get the money, Robert?” she asks presently,
eating little herself, and noticing how Robert bribes his
appetite with sups of ale.</p>

<p>“No. Davis was out.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do? I have only five and threepence
left, and this meat is not paid for.”</p>

<p>Pence make a sordid enumeration; but we talk of
pence, reader, when we have only pence to spend.</p>

<p>“We must sell something, that’s all,” says Mr. Conway,
with a kind of defiant recklessness in his manner.</p>

<p>She gives him a quick glance, looks at her child, and
then closes the knife and fork upon her plate.</p>

<p>He does not notice that she has eaten about as much
as would serve a bird for a meal; neither does he appear
to remark that she drinks water. <i>He</i>, at all events,
keeps the beer-jug at his elbow, from which, in a very
short time, he pours out the last glass.</p>

<p>The child alone continues eating.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> don’t know what’s to be done!” he exclaims in
a voice of suppressed anger, pushing his chair from the
table. “The people have dropped me for that French
quack, in Mornington Street. I saw three carriages at
his door when I passed just now. I ought never to
have left the old shop. I did well there.”</p>

<p>“You would do well here if you gave yourself a
chance,” says Dolly. “The lady who called yesterday
evening came again this morning. Martha told me she
looked annoyed when she heard you were out. She
will go to some one else, I suppose, now.”</p>

<p>“Let her!” he calls out. “How am I to know that
people are coming to me after dark? Week after week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
passes, and they don’t come, and&mdash;am I going to hang
about here a whole night, in the hope of a patient turning
up? Why didn’t she leave word at what hour she
meant to call to-day? I went out to collect some money,
and you know it, though I can guess what is in your
thoughts. But it’s false&mdash;there’s my hand on it!”</p>

<p>He let his hand fall heavily on the table, and stared
at his wife. She slightly turned from him, and looked
through the window. He left the table and began to
pace the room. The child, having emptied her plate
and wanting something to play with, had taken the
shilling Holdsworth had given her from her pocket, and
tried to make it spin on the cloth.</p>

<p>“What’s that Nelly has got there?” said Mr. Conway.</p>

<p>“A shilling,” answered Dolly.</p>

<p>“Did you give it her?... Look at our dinner!...
You would pamper that child if we were starving.
Talk to me of your five and threepence when you can
give your baby a shilling!”</p>

<p>“I did not give it to her.”</p>

<p>“Who then?”</p>

<p>“A gentleman.”</p>

<p>“What gentleman?”</p>

<p>“A gentleman lodging at Mrs. Parrot’s.”</p>

<p>He looked at her with irritable suspicion, and then
said:</p>

<p>“Did you see him give it? Did he take you and
the child for beggars?... Confound his impudence!...
Send Martha over to him with it.”</p>

<p>He turned to ring the bell.</p>

<p>“Stop!” said Dolly, quietly. “Nelly tells me that
Mrs. Parrot tapped on the window to speak to her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
when she went in, she saw the gentleman, who kissed
her, and gave her the shilling to buy her doll a parasol.
No insult could have been intended by this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was it!” exclaimed Mr. Conway, “Well,
and why do you let the child keep the money? She’ll
lose it. Take it from her.”</p>

<p>“It belongs to her. She will not lose it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she will. Nelly, give that money to your
mamma.”</p>

<p>But Nelly doubled her fist over it, and hid her hand
under the table.</p>

<p>“Do you hear what I say?” cried Mr. Conway.</p>

<p>“Why will you not let her keep it?” asked Dolly.</p>

<p>“Am I master here or not?” shouted Mr. Conway.
“Give that money to your mother, child!”</p>

<p>Nelly began to whimper, terrified by the man’s voice,
but loath to surrender her little treasure. He stepped
up to her, whipped the little hand from under the cloth,
and forcing the shilling from it, put it into his pocket.</p>

<p>“Though I’m a beggar by my own folly,” he exclaimed,
walking to the door, “I’ll not be insulted and
defied by the beggars I have brought about me.”</p>

<p>His fingers were in his pocket, and it seemed as
though he would pull the money out and fling it on the
table. But second thoughts prevailed; he jerked his
hat on his head, and marched out of the house, banging
the door after him.</p>

<p>Dolly watched to see if he would step across to Mrs.
Parrot’s; but he walked straight on.</p>

<p>“Hush, my darling, hush!” she exclaimed, catching
up the sobbing child. “Dolly shall have her parasol; I
will buy it myself. Hush, my pet! Nelly’s tears
break poor mamma’s heart.... Oh, John! oh, husband!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
she murmured; “why did God take you from
me? Why did He lead me and my little one into this
misery?”</p>

<p>Truly, it was misery, of a forlorn and hopeless kind.
But you have seen the man Dolly had married at his
worst. The most brutal husband is not always brutal.
The drunkard is not always drunk. More colours than
black and white go to the painting of a man off the
stage, where corked eyebrows strike no horror, and
blood-boltered cheeks prove nothing more than a neglect
of soap.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway had his soft hours, when he would shed
tears, smite his breast, and call himself a fiend&mdash;having
reference, by this flattering title, to nothing but his
behaviour to Dolly.</p>

<p>He was undoubtedly in love with her when he
married her; and the sweet face which had made him
haunt Southbourne, to the neglect of his patients, would
still, even after two years, have too much potency not
to occasionally soften and give movement to the humanities
which lay in him, hardened and drowned in drink.
Though he had always, as long as people could remember
him in Hanwitch, been what they called a dissipated
man, he had managed somehow or other to get a living,
to keep his landlord civil and wear good clothes. Ladies
were not wanting who called him handsome. His manner,
when sober, was courteous; his language correct;
his fingers dexterous in pulling teeth out or putting
teeth in. Those who knew anything of him knew that
he never saved a penny; that were he to make ten
thousand a year he would never save a penny; but they
always said that, if he would only take a deep-rooted
dislike to beer and brandy, go to bed at ten and rise at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
seven, attend to his business and give up smoking pipes
in the streets, he might obtain enough money to enable
him to keep a carriage and live in good style.</p>

<p>How he met Dolly matters little. She was living in
one room at Southbourne at that time, trying to obtain
a livelihood by taking in needlework. She was miserably
poor, with a little baby at her breast. Old Mr.
Newcome, the rector, did his best for her, and allowed
her what little he could afford out of his slender income,
which enabled her to pay her rent. But she had to
clothe and feed her child and herself, and the work she
procured was scanty and poorly paid for. God knows
how she managed to struggle through those days! Mr.
Conway asked her to marry him, but she answered “No,”
bitterly, for her love for Holdsworth was a passion.
Then her only friend, Mr. Newcome, died; her health
broke down; she was absolutely destitute; and so, for
her baby’s sake&mdash;but shrinking from the marriage as
one shrinks from the commission of an evil deed, and
with a heart in her so heavy that nothing but her love
for her child seemed to keep her alive&mdash;she gave her
hand to Mr. Conway, and went to live with him at
Hanwitch.</p>

<p>She had no affection for the man. Her marriage
was a bitter necessity, and she hated it and herself for
that. She had no knowledge of Conway’s habits, though
she had had penetration enough to miss certain moral
qualifications which are to be felt and cannot be explained.
Now she discovered that he was an intemperate,
improvident man, hasty in his temper, selfish, and
at the same time neglectful of his own interests.</p>

<p>He was some way ahead in his downward career
when he married her. The addition his marriage made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
to his expenses quickened his pace, as an object, rolling
slowly at first, improves its velocity in proportion to
the increase of its distance from the starting-point. One
by one his patients deserted him. He insulted his landlord,
to whom he owed money, who gave him notice to
quit. He then hired the little house in which we have
found him, and was now illustrating one of the great
mysteries of social life&mdash;the mystery of living without
money, of keeping a house over his head without a
shilling in his pocket, of wearing boots and coats without
the means in his purse to pay off the milkman’s
sixpenny score.</p>

<p>How is this done? There are people doing it every
day. They are doing more: they are keeping men-servants,
renting big houses, wearing fine dresses, frequenting
fashionable haunts, on nothing a year. How
Thackeray puzzled over this problem! How Dickens
tried to explain it and failed: for he is always driven
to a last moment, when some good genius steps forward
to help. Imagination can’t deal with a feat which
makes nothing do the work of a great deal.</p>

<p>There is no doubt something aggressive, even to good
nature, in the brooding melancholy that goes about its
duties lifelessly, which gives spiritless attention to
matters of moment and significance, which looks complaint
without speaking it, and addresses itself to every
task of life with an air of reproachful endurance.</p>

<p>A man possessed of such an inflammable temper as
Conway would be constantly taking fire in the presence
of such a melancholy; and it must be confessed that
Dolly embodied the part with some degree of completeness.
Silent and mournful submission to fate was the
wrong attitude to assume towards a man in whom was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
a good deal of the fool. A powerful virago, with
muscular arms and a venomous tongue, would have
kept him to his work and out of the taverns by the
irresistible influence of words supported by finger-nails.</p>

<p>Dolly, whose heart was never with him, soon learned
to despise him. It is true that she endeavoured, at the
beginning of their married life, to win him from his
extravagant and reckless courses by entreaties and the
mild persuasion of caresses; but she soon ceased her
appeals on finding that they took no effect, and only
rarely alluded to his habits, which, having plunged them
into poverty, were keeping them there, and sinking them
lower and lower each day.</p>

<p>With an inconsistency not very uncommon, he resented
her silence at the same time that he knew the
expression of her thoughts would enrage him. He was
still sufficiently under the control of her beauty to feel
jealous of her love, which he very well knew was with
the man they both thought dead. That truth had leaked
out long ago. He once heard her teaching her child to
pray; and presently lift up her own voice in a prayer
which had no name in it but John’s, whom she cried
aloud to, bidding his spirit take witness of the sufferings
which had driven her into an act that made her hateful
to herself. Once, when her gentle sweetness was stirred
into passion by him, she declared that she had never
loved him; that she had married him for her child’s
sake; that if God took her babe from her she would
kill herself, for her husband was in heaven, and his voice
spoke in her conscience, eternally reproaching her for
forgetting the vow they had made&mdash;<i>that though death
should sunder them, the survivor would be true to love and
memory, and live alone</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>But his petulance, his churlishness, his occasional
brutality, indeed, was not owing to this. She had merely
put his own knowledge of her into language; and since
he had married her, fully persuaded that the gift of her
hand had been dictated by pure necessity only, he could
scarcely find himself alienated by the confession of her
motive. Poverty and drink were the two demons that
mastered him. And poverty without drink would have
done the work; for his happened to be one of those
boneless natures which give under a very small weight;
one of those weak characters who, if they find themselves
in a gutter, are satisfied to lie there and roll
there, and moisten the mud with which they bedaub
those about them with tears, and make their settlements
gross with oaths, and shrieks, and reproaches.</p>

<span class="smaller">FATHER AND CHILD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>All next morning Holdsworth kept watch for Dolly
and his child, but did not see them. But Mr. Conway
had passed when Mrs. Parrot happened to be in the
room laying the cloth for dinner, and the woman had
directed Holdsworth’s attention to him. The glimpse
he obtained, however, was very brief. All that he saw
was a sandy-whiskered gentleman, with a tilted hat, aim
with rather uncertain legs for the gate with the brass
plate upon it, and vanish with an alacrity that was
painfully suggestive of a disordered vision.</p>

<p>“There he goes! Drunk as usual!” exclaimed Mrs.
Parrot, disgustfully, giving the table-cloth an angry
twitch.</p>

<p>“How does he live? I have seen nobody call at his
house yet!”</p>

<p>“No, sir; and I don’t think you’re likely to. Persons
as can’t get served at the other tooth-drawers are
too sensible to walk all this way to get their jaws broke.”</p>

<p>“Are they <i>very</i> poor, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, I suppose he must pay his rent somehow,
but I don’t know as he does anything more. I’m told
that they owe money all over the town, but the tradespeople
make no fuss, because, as Mr. Jairing the butcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
says to me, ‘It’s all very fine, Mrs. Parrot,’ he says,
‘talkin’ of hexecutions, but what’s the use o’ going to
the expense of a distress when there’s nothing to seize?’
There’s a deal in that, sir.”</p>

<p>“God help them!” muttered Holdsworth to himself.
Then looking up he said, “Do you think Mrs. Conway
would let her little girl come and have tea with me this
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I should think she would, sir, and feel honoured
by the askin’.”</p>

<p>“I have not seen the child to-day.”</p>

<p>“No, sir! Mrs. Conway don’t often come out. She
kapes a bit of a wench as does her arrands, and I’ve
told the slut times out o’ mind to put her bonnet on,
an’ not go flyin’ down the road as though a orficer was
arter her, disgracin’ of our neighbourhood, and frightening
away any respectable person as might be comin’ wi’
a bad tooth. I don’t think of <i>him</i>, sir. If I could put
a sixpence in his way I would, for the sake of his wife
an’ the little one.”</p>

<p>“How shall I invite little Nelly if I do not see her?”</p>

<p>“I’ll run across, if you like, when I’ve got your
dinner ready, and ask Mrs. Conway if she’ll let the
child come. Perhaps you’ll just watch, sir, and tell me
when the husband leaves the house. I don’t want to
meet him if I can help it.”</p>

<p>An hour elapsed before Holdsworth saw Mr. Conway
pass on his way to the High Street, on which he rang
the bell and informed Mrs. Parrot that she might now
call on Mrs. Conway in safety.</p>

<p>His anxiety to have the child impressed his landlady
as a very odd thing. She could understand his admiration
of Nelly; she could also understand his calling her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
in and giving her a kiss and a present. No man’s heart,
she considered, could fail to be warmed by the sight of
so pretty a little girl. But she could not understand
him posting himself at the window, and looking troubled
because he did not see the child, and showing himself
as anxious to have her to tea as if she was a grown
woman, and he was courting her.</p>

<p>She sailed across the road (watched by Holdsworth),
her cap-strings streaming over her shoulders, and walked
up to the door of the Conways’ house, and gave a single
knock. She was kept waiting so long, that when the
door was at last opened by the “bit of a slut,” who, to
judge by her complexion, appeared to have been devoting
the last hour or two to black-leading her face, Mrs.
Parrot, instead of asking for Mrs. Conway, began storming
at her for “kaping respectable folks on the doorsteps
while she sat readin’ ha’porths o’ bad fiction by the
kitchen fire.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t readin’. I didn’t hear yer. Who do you
want&mdash;missus?” said the girl sulkily.</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Conway, of course. Show me in, and
go an’ tell her at once that I’m here,” replied Mrs.
Parrot, not waiting to be shown in, but pushing into
the middle of the passage.</p>

<p>The girl shambled off, and presently Mrs. Conway
came up the kitchen stairs. The skirt of her dress was
pinned up at the waist, and her arm-sleeves were above
her elbows, displaying the whiteness and fineness of the
skin, though the arms were very thin.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Mrs. Parrot? You will excuse my
wretched untidy appearance. I am doing a little washing
downstairs, and would not keep you waiting whilst
I made myself presentable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>“Niver mention it, ma’am,” answered Mrs. Parrot,
looking with pleasure, mingled with pain, at the sweet
face, in which, now that there was no hat to shadow it
the sorrow and care were clearly seen. Her prettiness
was but enhanced by the looped-up skirt, showing the
little feet and small firm ankles. Her bright hair was
in disorder, and there was the little flush of recent exertion
on her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I’ve called wi’ a message from my gentleman lodger.
He wants Miss Nelly to drink tea with him, and sent
me across to ask you to let her come.”</p>

<p>“The same gentleman who gave Nelly a shilling
yesterday?” asked Dolly, looking half surprised and
half pleased.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am. He’s a very nice person, and seems
uncommon partial to children. He’s been all the morning
on the look-out for your little gal, and I hope you’ll
let her come, ma’am, and bring her doll wi’ her, for I
think he’ll take it to heart if you refuse.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I will certainly send her. Will half-past three
do? I shall have to dress her. Pray give my compliments
to the gentleman, and thank him for his kindness.
You have not told me his name.”</p>

<p>“Hampden, ma’am; Mr. Hampden.”</p>

<p>“I have not yet seen him. Is he an old man? Few
young men care for children.”</p>

<p>“To tell you the truth, ma’am, I’ve got no more idea
of his age, than I have of the age of my house. He’s
got a deal o’ gray hair on his head, and yet he isn’t an
old man either, although to see him walk, leanin’ on his
stick, you’d take him to be sixty. I think he means to
make friends wi’ your little gal, if you’ll let him, just
for want o’ company. He don’t seem to know anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
in Hanwitch, nor to follow any callin’ like. I doubt he’s
a bit rich; but you see, ma’am, he only took my lodgin’s
the day before yesterday, and I’ve not had time to make
him quite out yit.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Mrs. Parrot dropped a courtesy, and
turned to depart, taking a quick comprehensive glance
at the dingy little parlour as she passed, and mentally
comparing it with her own rooms.</p>

<p>Holdsworth was at the window when she returned,
and she could hardly forbear laughing, so tickled was
she by his expectant face.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Conway’s compliments, sir, and she says that
her little gal will be with you at half-past three,
thankin’ you for your kindness,” said she, her eyes
twinkling with her suppressed but perfectly good-natured
mirth.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Parrot, for taking so much
trouble,” exclaimed Holdsworth gleefully. “What
time is it now? A quarter to three. I shall just have
time to walk into the High Street and buy a cake.
She will like a cake&mdash;a plum-cake I think; and shall I
get some marmalade? Yes, she will enjoy marmalade&mdash;and
what else? Tell me, Mrs. Parrot; what do
little children like?”</p>

<p>“Why, mostly sweet things, sir. I guess the marmalade’ll
take Miss Nelly’s fancy. But don’t you trouble,
sir; I can run out and buy you what you want.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I am obliged to you. There are other things
she might like which I shouldn’t be able to remember
without seeing them. We will have tea at four, Mrs.
Parrot. I shall be back in twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot watched him leave the house and walk
down the road as swiftly as he could, leaning on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
stick. “Well, if iver I saw the like of this!” she exclaimed
aloud. “I’ll not tell mother; it might scare
her. There’s something downright sing’ler in the
notion of a stranger takin’ all this trouble, and goin’
almost wild-like all along of a little gal he never saw
before yisterday. Some folks ’ud call it alarmin’.”</p>

<p><i>Her</i> nerves, however, were equal to the occasion; for
whilst Holdsworth was away, she journeyed upstairs
and unlocked a little glass-fronted cupboard, screwed
into a corner of her bedroom, from which she took a
teapot, a cream-jug, and two cups and saucers of
brilliantly-coloured china; likewise from an open box
under her bed a tray magnificently decorated with
mother-of-pearl birds of paradise seated on pink trees,
and surrounded by a prospect not to be paralleled on
this side the moon.</p>

<p>She returned to the kitchen with these things, and
then entered the garden and picked a bouquet of sweet-scented
flowers, with which she furnished the tray.
Then she set to work upon a loaf of bread, and produced
in no time a number of thin and appetising slices;
which done, and the tray being arranged, she fell back
a step to admire the effect.</p>

<p>At a quarter-past three Holdsworth returned, followed
by a boy with his arms full of bags. He called to Mrs.
Parrot, who came out and took the bags from the boy,
and placed them upon the dining-room table. More
things than edibles had been purchased; though of
these there was enough to give an evening party upon&mdash;fruit,
cakes, pots of jam, gingerbread-nuts, sweetmeats,
tarts; there was a doll; there was also a horse and
cart; and there was an immense box of bricks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot turned pale, and was much too astonished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
to speak, as Holdsworth thrust the bags and pots, the
buns and the tarts, into her arms, and requested her to
take them at once into the kitchen, and display them
on plates to the very best advantage, ready for the little
one when the bell should ring for tea. He then hid
the toys in a closet, and stationed himself at the window
to watch for Nelly.</p>

<p>Punctual to the moment, she came out of the house,
led by the hand by the servant, who looked horribly
grimy. Holdsworth ran to the door and opened it, and
when the child came timidly up to him, snatched her
up in his arms, and hastened with her into the sitting-room,
kissing her all the way.</p>

<p>“There’s a good little pet,” he said sitting down and
keeping her on his knee. “Let me take off your hat.
Nelly mustn’t be afraid of me.”</p>

<p>“My own! my own!” he murmured, as his lingering
fingers caressed her soft hair, and he gazed with
passionate love at her big eyes, roving with a half-scared
expression from his face around the room.</p>

<p>“Me dot dolly,” she said, producing the old toy from
under her cloak.</p>

<p>“Ay, that’s right; and dolly shall have a slice of
cake all to herself. Here she is!” he exclaimed, seeing
Mrs. Parrot peeping in at the door. “Will you take
her hat and this little cape?”</p>

<p>“How do you do, dear?” said Mrs. Parrot, giving
the child a kiss.</p>

<p>“Look at my frock!” exclaimed Nelly, holding up
her dress, which had a little embroidery work upon it,
and which bore marks of much patient mending and
darning.</p>

<p>“Beautiful! beautiful!” cried Mrs. Parrot. “I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
set the kettle on to bile, sir, and tea’ll be ready whiniver
you’re pleased to want it.”</p>

<p>So saying, she dropped a courtesy, being greatly impressed
by Mr. Hampden’s undoubted wealth, illustrated
by his prodigal purchases, and withdrew.</p>

<p>Father and child! A lonely man, gentle, honourable,
faithful, as any whom God in His wisdom has
chosen to afflict, opening his heart to receive and fold
up the sweetness and innocence of his own little baby!</p>

<p>Ah! I think even Mrs. Parrot might have guessed
the strange mystery of this man’s desire for the child,
had she but watched him from some secret hiding-place
when the door had closed upon her.</p>

<p>He surrendered himself to his emotion when he felt
himself alone with the little girl, and for many moments
could not speak to her, could do no more than look at
her, searching her fairy lineaments with something
almost of a woman’s ecstasy, reading his brief history of
hopeful, beautiful love in her fresh deep eyes, and drinking
in greedily the memories of the days that were no
more, which thronged from the face that mirrored his
as it was when Dolly knew him, as the dew-drop
mirrors the sun.</p>

<p>But he was recalled to himself by the gathering expression
of fear in Nelly. Indeed, there was something
alarming enough to her in the concentrated passion, all
soft and holy as it was, that shone in his fixed regard.</p>

<p>Such abandonment to feeling would not do, if the
part he was to play was to be complete.</p>

<p>He placed her gently on the floor, and, going to the
cupboard, brought out the doll.</p>

<p>“See, Nelly! here is a little lady I invited expressly
to drink tea with you. She told me that she had often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
seen you pass her shop in the High Street, and that she
wanted to live with you. You must take her home
when you leave me, will you?”</p>

<p>Nelly stood for a moment transfixed by the spectacle
of this gorgeously-dressed creature, resplendent in blue
gauze, bronzed boots, gilt sash, and flowing red feather.
Then&mdash;so permanent is human affection&mdash;she threw
down her old doll and ran forward, with outstretched
arms, to welcome and hug the stranger.</p>

<p>But the sum of her amazement was not yet made out.
Once more Holdsworth dived into the mysterious cupboard
and produced the horse and cart, which, he told
Nelly, was the chariot that had brought the young lady
to his house, and without which she never condescended
to take the air, being much too fine a lady to walk.
The box of bricks followed; and presently Nelly was
on the floor, taking up the three toys one after the other
in quick succession, her avariciousness of enjoyment
perplexed by the number of the objects that ministered
to it.</p>

<p>Holdsworth knelt by her side and watched her face.</p>

<p>A man need not be a father to find something elevating
and purifying in the contemplation of a child’s
countenance, varied by tiny innocent emotions, reflecting
the little play of her small passions, as her eyes
reflect the objects that surround her. But that subtle
and sacred bond, which unites a child’s life to a parent’s
heart, creates an impulse to such contemplation which
makes the pleasure sweeter than any other kind of
pleasure, by the infusion of an exquisite pathos, mingled
with the only kind of pride to which vanity seems to
contribute nothing.</p>

<p>The natural bitterness which Holdsworth felt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
thinking that his little girl did not know him, that misfortune
had thrust his love out of the sphere of her own
and his wife’s life, was converted into tender melancholy
by the emotions Nelly’s presence excited, and left his
pleasure unalloyed by pain. Here was a little being
who was his at least; his by a right no sin, no folly, no
error could challenge; indisputably his, to survive, if
God permitted, into his future, when the time should
come for him to call himself aloud by the name of
Father, and ask her love as some recompense for that
present sacrifice of his which was enforced by grand
obedience to the high laws of morality.</p>

<p>How hard it was to be thus true to himself, thus
true to his wife, thus true to the little one who must
needs share some portion of that obligation of shame
which would befall them all, were he to confess himself&mdash;Judge!
for you see him kneeling by his child’s side;
you may behold his love in his eyes; you may know
that no upturned luminous glance of hers but thrills
along the chords of his passion, and makes his heart
gush forth its overfull tenderness, even until his sight
grows humid, and he turns his thoughts in a piteous
aside to God for courage and will, so to sustain this
strange, pathetic happiness, that no sorrow shall follow it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Nelly, we will have tea now,” he says; and he
rings the bell, and then comes up to the child again,
and, turns her face up, kisses her suddenly, and seats
himself at a distance with his chin upon his hand.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Parrot came in, armed with the tray,
which she placed upon the table, while she challenged
her lodger’s admiration by lightly lifting her gray eyes
and smirking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Yes, it was very beautiful. The bouquet made the
room odoriferous at once; the birds of paradise looked
splendid; the cups were elegant enough to induce one
to go on drinking tea with stubborn disregard of the
nervous system, for hours and hours together, if only
for an excuse to handle them and have them under the
eye. In order to bring little Nelly’s head a little above
the level of the table, Holdsworth piled three or four
of the folios on a chair, on which he seated her; and
that the two dolls might be seen to advantage, he very
ingeniously tied them together, and set them on a chair,
leaning against the table, with a plate and a slice of
bread-and-butter before them; whereat Nelly laughed
rapturously, clapping her hands and filling the room
with sweet sounds.</p>

<p>It was all Fairyland, these cups and toys and cakes
and what not, to the little girl, whose tea at home was
often no more than a slice of dry bread, when her step-father
had drunk away the money he should have given
to his wife, and left her without the means to purchase
an ounce of butter. The sun was at the back of the
house, and its rules of yellow light flooded the floor at
the extremity of the apartment, and flung a golden haze
over that portion of the room where the table stood.
There was something so charming in the scene thus delicately
lighted, that Mrs. Parrot, who had been struggling
with her modesty for some minutes, while she fidgeted
over the plates and dishes, suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I humbly beg parding for the liberty, sir, but would
you mind mother just takin’ one peep? She came into
the kitchen while I was dressin’ the tray, an’ I told her
what was goin’ forward, an’ I think it ’ud do her heart
good to see this beautiful show.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let her come by all means,” replied Holdsworth,
touched and diverted by the perfect simplicity of these
people.</p>

<p>Presently fell a respectful knock, and Mrs. Parrot
re-entered, followed by a Roman nose that came and
vanished like an optical delusion near the handle of the
door.</p>

<p>“Come in, mother; the gentleman’s kind enough to
say you may,” said Mrs. Parrot; and in faltered the old
woman, dropping an aged courtesy, and making her
spectacles chatter in their wooden case as she strove to
withdraw them.</p>

<p>“Ain’t this a picter, mother?”</p>

<p>“Niver see anything to aquil it,” replied the old lady,
putting on her spectacles and gazing around her with
many a convulsive motion of the head. “Why, Sairey,
them’s our best cups!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I told you I was usin’ them. Don’t you see
the little gal, mother?”</p>

<p>“See her? Yes,&mdash;of course I do. But she don’t
want an old ’ooman like me to kiss her, eh, my pretty?
I’m very much obleeged, sir,” dropping a creaking
courtesy, “for the sight o’ this table.”</p>

<p>“Would your mother like one of these cakes for her
tea?” said Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, you’re very good.&mdash;Mother, the gentleman
wants to know if you’ll accept of one of these cakes for
your tea?”</p>

<p>“Thank ye, sir. I relish a bit o’ somethin’ sweet
now and agin,” replied the old lady, dropping another
courtesy as she received the cake. “I was cook to Squire
Harrowden, lar’ bless yer! I dessay it were years afore
you was born, and they did say as there niver was my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
aquil i’ the makin’ o’ pie-crust. I’ve cooked for as
many as a hundred and tin persons, ay, that I have,”
with intense earnestness, “as Sairey’ll bear me witness,
for she’s heerd the story from her own father, as was
gamekeeper to the Squire, an’ a more likely man you
niver see, sir. His name was Cramp, which he was a
Croydon man, as you may happen to know the name if
you was iver in them parts.”</p>

<p>“Come, mother, we have stopped long enough,” exclaimed
Mrs. Parrot, putting her hand upon the old
lady’s arm.</p>

<p>They both courtesied; and then the old woman let
fall the cake, which rolled under the table. Holdsworth
recovered it for her, which act of condescension was so
overwhelming that she let the cake fall again; on which
Mrs. Parrot lost her temper, and hurried the old dame
through the door at a velocity to which her legs were
quite unused, and possibly quite unequal. She might
be heard feebly remonstrating in a voice similar to the
sound a key makes when turned in a rusty lock; and
then the door was closed, and Holdsworth and Nelly
were left alone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If Mrs. Parrot had dared, she would have been glad
to advise Holdsworth “not to let the little gal eat too
much, there bein’ nothing worse nor sweetstuff for young
stomachs, which finds milk-and-water sometimes too
much for ’em.” But, happily, Nelly was not a glutton;
besides, the majority of human beings at her age eat
only as much as they want, and no more; we wait until
our judgment is matured, until life is precious, until we
have experienced most of the distempers which arise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
from an overloaded stomach, before making ourselves
thoroughly ill with over-feeding!</p>

<p>By this time the child was perfectly at home with
Holdsworth, and enjoying herself immensely, varying a
bite at a slice of cake with a bite at some bread covered
with jam, sipping the good milk Holdsworth had obtained
for her with great gravity, and staring at the dolls, and
then bending to make sure that her bricks had not taken
to their heels while she was looking at the horse and
cart, and that the horse had not bolted with the cart
while she was looking at her bricks.</p>

<p>Holdsworth scarcely removed his eyes from her face.
When he spoke to her there was a softness in his voice
that melted like music on the ear.</p>

<p>At last she pushed her plate away, and Holdsworth
rang the bell, and giving Mrs. Parrot private instructions
to make up a parcel of the remainder of the cakes, etc.,
ready for Nelly to take home with her, he clasped the
child’s hand and went with her into the garden, she holding
the new doll, he dragging the horse and cart after him.</p>

<p>There was a square of grass in this garden, and a
bench on it; and here Holdsworth sat, while Nelly
played with her toys.</p>

<p>It was a roomy, old-fashioned garden, with aged
walls, full of rusty nails and rotten ligatures, and a few
tall pear-trees sheltering a small circumference of ground
at their feet; and many fruit-trees sprawling wildly
against the walls. The moss was like a carpet on the
flint walk, and the box at the side of the bed was high
and thick; and at the top of the garden was an old hencoop,
hedged about with wirework, behind which some
dozen hens scratched the soil for worms, and made the
air drowsy with their odd, half-suppressed mutterings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Moods possess us, sometimes, which such a scene as
this will affect more pleasurably than a garden bursting
with exotics, and tended with the highest artistic judgment.
There is something very calming in homely
shrubs, and old fruit-trees with their roots hidden by the
long, vivid grass, and uncouth weeds thrusting their rude
shapes among violet beds; and the solemn chatter of
barn-door hens sunning themselves in hot spaces, or
lying like dead things with a wing half-buried in sand
and dirt, will sometimes impart a more agreeable tranquillity
to the mind than the choicest songs of nightingales
warbled in groves under a full moon.</p>

<p>Holdsworth suffered the child to have her full sportive
will for some time, and then, thinking her tired, called
her to him.</p>

<p>She ran to him at once, and he perched her on his
knee.</p>

<p>“Is Nelly afraid of me now?”</p>

<p>“No. Nelly dot afraid. Nelly loves ’oo.”</p>

<p>In proof whereof she put her mouth up for a kiss.</p>

<p>“Will Nelly come to see me every day?”</p>

<p>“Det.”</p>

<p>“Does Nelly’s papa love her?”</p>

<p>He believed that she had been taught to regard Mr.
Conway as her papa. It was a sore tax upon the gentle
mood then on him to put the question in that form, but
he wished to learn if his child were well treated by her
step-father.</p>

<p>The question puzzled her. Indeed, she was a very
little thing, and backward in her speech. It was delicious
to see her knit her tiny brows, and gaze with her
full, deep, earnest eyes on Holdsworth, with a half-intelligence
in her face, and all the rest child-sweetness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>Like all children, who cannot answer a question, she
remained silent; a hint parents would sometimes do
well to take.</p>

<p>“Does Nelly get plenty to eat?”</p>

<p>“Det.”</p>

<p>This was not quite true; but then Holdsworth, who
knew nothing of children, was ignorant that little infants
will borrow their answers from your voice or face, so
that to get an affirmative from them you have only to
speak or look affirmatively.</p>

<p>“Does mamma teach Nelly to pray?”</p>

<p>“Det. Nelly pray.”</p>

<p>And, to prove how well she could pray, she put her
two hands together, hung down her head, and whispered:</p>

<p>“Dod bless dear mamma and Nelly. Dod bless little
Nelly’s dear papa.”</p>

<p>She looked up coyly, as though ashamed.</p>

<p>Dear reader, smile not at these simple words, nor
think them puerile. When we behold a little child
praying, we know how the angels worship God.</p>

<p>A sob broke from Holdsworth as she ceased. Who
was little Nelly’s dear papa but he? His wife’s love
had dictated that prayer, and it was their child who
told him of her love. Ah! God had deigned to hear
that prayer, whispered by a wife’s heart through the
lips of her infant, and had blessed him with this knowledge
of her devotion, and had brought him from afar
to know it.</p>

<p>No; not want of love had made her faithless to his
memory. Faithless she was not&mdash;she could not be if
her heart nightly spoke to God of him through her
child.</p>

<p>Let him look at the little girl now; let him feel the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
fulness of the love she inspired in him; let him imagine
that he was desolate and friendless, and in want, and
that this frail flower, this tender little lamb, pined and
grew wan and ragged for food and raiment; let him
mingle with his own emotion the pain and torment
which a mother’s heart would feel in the presence of
this baby’s sufferings; and then let him condemn his
wife, if he could, for sacrificing her memories and accepting
food and shelter from any hand that offered them
under any honourable conditions.</p>

<p>He could not speak again for some time; and Nelly,
growing tired of sitting, slipped from his knee, and
betook herself to her toys.</p>

<p>Then his eyes kindled anew, and he watched her
eagerly. He longed to ask her questions&mdash;to hear her
lisp him sweet assurances of his Dolly’s love&mdash;to learn
from her little lips that her mother was his, had been,
would always be his, though separated from him by a
barrier as formidable as death. But there was no question
he could put which the child might not repeat again;
for, backward as she was in speech, her small imperfect
language would be intelligible enough to the mother.
His curiosity would be too unnatural in a stranger not to
excite Dolly’s suspicions; and if they should not even
lead to the discovery of his secret, they might be the
means of breaking off all intercourse between him and
his child.</p>

<p>And so he remained silent; and presently, as he sat
watching the little creature pushing her doll to and fro
in the cart and talking to herself, a calm came upon his
heart&mdash;a sense of exquisite repose and security. You
would have said, to look upon him and remark the placid
sweetness that reigned in his face, that the child’s prayer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
had veritably done its office&mdash;that God had blessed him
indeed.</p>

<p>A long hour passed. The garden was fresh and cool;
the declining sun mellowed the gray walls and kindled
many little suns in the vine-draped windows; the sparrows
flitted quickly with short chirrups from tree to
tree; and the crooning of the hens added completeness
to the peace and tenderness that breathed in the
air.</p>

<p>Once again Nelly was on Holdsworth’s knee, fetching
vague replies from her struggling perceptions for his
questions, when Mrs. Parrot came out of the house and
said that Mrs. Conway was in the sitting-room, waiting
to take her little girl home.</p>

<p>Holdsworth glanced quickly at the window of the
room, but did not see her. He put the child down
hurriedly, and said:</p>

<p>“There, my little pet, run along with Mrs. Parrot.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you come and speak to Mrs. Conway, sir?”
asked Mrs. Parrot. “She wants to thank you for your
kindness.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no&mdash;pray don’t let her call it kindness,” stammered
Holdsworth, who was very pale.</p>

<p>“I’m sure she’ll take it unkind if you won’t let her
thank you, sir,” said Mrs. Parrot earnestly. “She’s
been watching you both through the window for the last
five minutes, an’ I couldn’t help tellin’ her what a fine
treat you have given Miss Nelly. Besides, she’s seen
them toys,” she added, looking at Nelly’s presents.</p>

<p>A whole lifetime of nervous pain was in that moment’s
pause. Could he meet her, speak to her, and remain
unknown? His desire was to hide. It seemed inconceivable
that in five years such a change should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
wrought in him as to render him unrecognisable by his
wife.</p>

<p>But the pressing necessity of immediate action was
too sudden to give his imagination time to alarm his
judgment. He must dare the encounter, since it was
not to be obviated by any means which might not
prove more productive of suspicion than bold confrontment.</p>

<p>He laid the utmost tyranny of his will upon his feelings,
and saying:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right, Mrs. Parrot. Mrs. Conway
will think me rude if I do not see her,” took Nelly’s
hand and walked with her to the house.</p>

<p>Dolly was seated in an arm-chair near the fireplace,
leaning her cheek on her hand. Her attitude showed
that she had been watching the group in the garden.</p>

<p>She stood up when Holdsworth entered and bowed
to him.</p>

<p>Nelly ran to her, holding up her doll.</p>

<p>“Look, mamma!”</p>

<p>The action was timely; it enabled Holdsworth to
walk to the side of the window, where the shadow lay
darkest, and there he stood.</p>

<p>This he had sense enough to do; but for a moment
or two the room swam round him, and he grasped the
back of a chair.</p>

<p><i>Would she know him?</i></p>

<p>That thought swept like a galvanic shock through
him, and made his blood tingle.</p>

<p>It brought hope with it and fear; a wild paradoxical
emotion of yearning love and the blighting sense of the
sorrow and dishonour recognition would involve.</p>

<p>“I have to thank you very much, Mr. Hampden, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
your attention to my little girl,” she said in a low sweet
voice&mdash;how remembered!</p>

<p>“Her society gives me great happiness,” he replied,
with the faintest tremor in his tone.</p>

<p>It might have been that sign of agitation which made
her look at him suddenly.</p>

<p>His gaze sank. But he felt her eyes upon his face,
and the eager, restless scrutiny that filled them.</p>

<p>But if ever a memory of something infinitely beloved
to her had been renewed by his reply, it melted upon
her conviction of the death of him whom Holdsworth’s
voice had recalled to her, as snow upon water.</p>

<p>Could it have been otherwise?</p>

<p>Not five years&mdash;not twenty years&mdash;not a lifetime,
maybe, of ordinary sufferings could have so transformed
his face but that her love could have pierced the mask.</p>

<p>But the unnatural misery of those ten days in the
open boat&mdash;the hunger that had wasted, the agonising
thirst that had twisted his face out of all likeness to what
it had been, the growth of beard and moustache that
hid the lower part of the countenance, the gray hair, the
bare forehead, the deformed eyebrows, the rugged indent
between the brows, the stooped form!&mdash;</p>

<p>Here was a transformation that would have defied a
mother’s instincts&mdash;that would have offered an impenetrable
front to perception barbed into keenness by the
profoundest love that ever warmed the heart.</p>

<p>And yet, looking at this woman attentively&mdash;looking
at her gazing at yonder man, cowering, it might almost
seem, in the friendly shadow of the wall&mdash;there was
something in her eyes, something in her face, something in
her whole manner, that would have quickened your pulse
with a moment of breathless suspense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>In such matters, as in the loss of memory, we must
recognise the existence of a deep spiritual insight having
no reference to the revelations of the mind. There are
convictions which do not satisfy, though cemented by
logic and acted on by their possessor with sincere conscience.
Against such convictions instincts will surge
as waves break upon a shore. Echoes are awakened,
but are thought purposeless. And the conviction is
still maintained, while the secret truth rolls at its base.</p>

<p>The voice of Holdsworth, but not his face, had set
Dolly’s instincts in motion.</p>

<p>But then her conviction that Holdsworth was dead
was a permanent one; and under it her instincts subsided
into uneasy sleep, though there was a shadow of
melancholy on her face when she removed her eyes,
which had not been there before Holdsworth spoke.</p>

<p>“I hope Nelly has been good, Mr. Hampden.”</p>

<p>“Very good, indeed.”</p>

<p>He seemed to know that the crisis was passed, for he
breathed more freely, looked at her, and removed his
hand from the chair.</p>

<p>“These toys are very beautiful. I really feel unable
to express my gratitude to you.”</p>

<p>“You owe me no thanks. My gratitude is due to
you for allowing your sweet little girl to come and see
me.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Parrot tells me you are very fond of children?”</p>

<p>“Very. I hope little Nelly will often be here. I
am quite alone, and she cheers me with her pretty
prattle.”</p>

<p>She glanced at him quickly and sympathetically, as
he said he was alone, and sighed.</p>

<p>Holdsworth noticed that her dress was very shabby;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
but her beauty lost nothing by her apparel. He thought
her looking sweeter than when he had left her five
years before. Her riper charms were made touching
by an under colouring of sadness, and there was languor
in her movements and speech&mdash;sign of heart-weariness.</p>

<p>“It is time for us to get home, Nelly,” she said,
looking uneasily towards the window. “Go and give
Mr. Hampden a kiss, and thank him prettily for his
beautiful presents.”</p>

<p>The child approached Holdsworth, who kissed her
gently, repressing the passionate emotion that, had he
been alone, would have prompted him to raise her in
his arms and press her to his breast.</p>

<p>“Here are some little cakes,” he said, taking the
parcel Mrs. Parrot had prepared, and giving them to
the child, but addressing Dolly, “which will amuse her
to play with. When may she come again, Mrs. Conway?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she must not intrude ...”</p>

<p>“No, no! she cannot come too often. Pray let me
make a companion of her. She has completely won
my heart. May she not walk with me sometimes? I
promise to take as much care of her as if she were my
own child.”</p>

<p>He had advanced a step and spoke eagerly, bending
forward; but meeting her full eyes fixed on him with a
little frown of mingled fear and amazement, he turned
pale, fell back a step, and forcing a smile, said hurriedly:</p>

<p>“I am sometimes&mdash;sometimes laughed at for&mdash;for
my love of children.”</p>

<p>She did not answer him for some moments, but
stood watching him with a startled expression, suggesting
both fascination and terror. Then she averted her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
eyes slowly, the colour went out of her cheeks, and she
murmured something under her breath.</p>

<p>“You remind me of one who was very dear to me
... I beg your pardon ... there is often a strange
resemblance in the tones of voices.”</p>

<p>She took the child’s hand, and was mechanically walking
to the door.</p>

<p>“Me want dolly and horse,” said Nelly, holding
back.</p>

<p>Holdsworth picked up the toys, and went into the
passage to open the door. They bowed to each other,
and Holdsworth returned to the sitting-room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The moment he had dreaded had come and was
gone. He had met his wife, spoken with her, and she
did not know him.</p>

<p>He had noticed the sudden surprise and fear that
had come into her face; he had noticed the deeply
thoughtful mood in which she had quitted the house.
But these things proved no more than this: that a note,
familiar to her ear, still lived in the tones of his voice,
and had aroused for awhile the memory which rarely
disturbed her now, save in dreams at night.</p>

<p>Well! what he wished had happened. Suffering
had deformed him, time had changed him, to some purpose.
He could play the game of life anew, as one
freshly come upon the stage. His paradise was closed
to him, but he could stand at the gate and be a looker-on
at the sphere in which his most sacred interests
played their parts; he could respect and uphold, by his
withdrawal and secrecy, her, whose vows to him his
imagined death had cancelled; he could have his child
for a playmate, and sow in her heart those seeds of love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
which, if God should ever suffer her to know her father,
would, in the fulness of time, bless him with an abundant
harvest of happiness.</p>

<p>But, though he would not, for the worth of his life,
have had things otherwise than they were, yet, as he
stood in the room from which the light had departed
with his child’s sweet face, the tears rose to his eyes
and sobs convulsed him.</p>

<p>Oh, it was hard to look back upon his sufferings, and
feel that nothing but suffering yet remained; hard and
bitter to behold those whom he loved, those whose love
would spring to meet him were he to make but one
little sign, and to know that he was as dead to them as
if the great desolate sea rolled over his body.</p>

<p>But here was a noble self-sacrificing heart that could
not long mourn its own afflictions. High virtues are
always pregnant with high consolations, and a good
man’s grief for himself is short because he carries many
tender ministers to it in his bosom. There was no
triumph now to complete, for his conquest over impulse
had been achieved at Southbourne. He drew to the
open window at the back, where the air was fragrant
with the smell of hay from the meadows beyond, and
the cool evening perfumes of flowers hidden amid the
shrubbery in the garden, and watched the sun sinking,
whilst his thoughts followed it to the distant deep, whose
breast it overhung, and on whose lonely surface he had
watched it rising and setting with a despair the memory
of which filled him with thoughts too deep for tears.</p>

<span class="smaller">DOLLY’S THOUGHTS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Three days passed before Holdsworth saw Nelly again.
He then, from his window, beheld her playing on the
pavement opposite with the horse and cart he had given
her.</p>

<p>He called, and she came running over to him gleefully
at once.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot was despatched to request Mrs. Conway’s
leave that Nelly might stop to tea with Mr. Hampden,
and returned to say that “the little gal might, with the
greatest of pleasure.”</p>

<p>Again and again Nelly was summoned out of the
road by Holdsworth, sometimes of a morning, sometimes
of an afternoon, when he could see her. The little creature
soon learnt to resist all her mother’s suggestions
that she should play in the back garden; she liked the
pavement in the road, especially the pavement opposite
Holdsworth’s lodgings, and with an air of inscrutable
mystery would keep a sharp look-out for Holdsworth,
while she feigned to be absorbed in her toy. Ah, the
artfulness of some little girls! But then there were
always gingerbread and cakes for her in the miraculous
cupboard in the corner of Holdsworth’s room; and the
temptation to obtain these luxuries, and to evade the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
slice of bread and cup of thin milk and water which
formed her evening meal at home, was sometimes powerful
enough to send her toddling out of the back garden,
where her mother placed her, into the road, actually
unobserved by mamma, who, imagining that she still
played in the garden, would be astonished by Mrs.
Parrot coming across and saying that Miss Nelly was
with Mr. Hampden, and please might she stop to tea.</p>

<p>Often, if Holdsworth had the good fortune to see his
little girl in the morning, or early in the afternoon, he
would put on his hat, and leaving word with Mrs. Parrot
to tell Mrs. Conway, should she ask, that he had taken
Nelly for a walk, clasp the child’s hand and stroll with
her into the town.</p>

<p>Nelly enjoyed these rambles hugely. Their two
figures contrasted strangely, and many a woman’s eyes
would follow them, because the measured step, the
thoughtful brow, the sunken face of the man, and the
golden-haired child at his side, with her bright young
face and big eyes drinking in the sights and processions
of the streets, and little twinkling feet, tripping so fleetly
and dancingly along, that one would say she held his
hand to prevent herself flying away, formed a picture
which a woman’s heart would love to contemplate for
its prettiness.</p>

<p>They would sometimes turn out of the hot streets,
when Nelly’s listless glance would show her weary at
last of the splendours of the toy-shops (before which
they regularly stopped) and wander to the river’s side;
and there, in the shadow of trees, Holdsworth would
rest himself, while Nelly cleared the space around her
of all the daisies and buttercups she could find.</p>

<p>These were hours of deep and calm enjoyment to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Holdsworth, who, until the chimes of the town clocks
warned him to rise, would lie, with his head supported
on his elbow, that his face might be close to Nelly’s
that he might catch every fluctuating expression that
made her eyes an endless series of sweet signs, that he
might hear every faltering syllable that fell from her
lips.</p>

<p>Soft and cool were the sounds the river made, as its
gentle tide gurgled a secret music among the high rushes,
or rippled round stumps of trees or projections of stone
lodged in the bank. Winged insects flashed many-coloured
lights upon the eye as they swept from shadow
to shadow, parted by a rivulet of sunshine falling through
the openings in the trees. Now and again a trout leaped
with a pleasant and lazy splash. From the shores
opposite, behind the trees, came the smell of the warm
red clover, mingled with the multitudinous hum of bees.
Afar, at a bend of the stream, an angler might stand
watching his quill, with his head and shoulders mirrored
in the clear water&mdash;so exquisite the counterfeit that one
might easily make a parable out of it, and sermonise
slumberously, as befitted the drowsy influence of the hot
day, on those illusions of life which mock the heart they
mislead in its search after truth.</p>

<p>Once, when Holdsworth was taking Nelly home, after
a long rest on the river’s edge, he met Mr. Conway, who
stared very hard, but passed on without addressing the
child. Nelly drew close to Holdsworth when she saw
the man.</p>

<p>Holdsworth knew Conway perfectly well by sight
now. The dentist had repeatedly passed the window
at which Holdsworth stationed himself on the look-out
for Nelly; and of late, it might have been noticed, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
would glance with no unfriendly expression towards Mrs.
Parrot’s old-fashioned house.</p>

<p>His walk, when he did not actually reel, as he very
often did, might have been studied with some disgust
as an illustration of character. It was a species of gliding
movement, such as a man might be supposed to
adopt, whose self-abasement he himself holds irrevocable,
and who has made up his mind no longer to walk,
but to sneak through life. The influence of importunate
creditors might be marked in the quick, furtive
glancing of the eye, that wandered from side to side
and challenged every individual it rested upon. One
half-dulled perception of his social obligations might
yet linger; or perhaps it was an innate love of dress
which, from being a vice in prosperity, would degenerate
into a kind of sickly virtue in poverty, that gave
him an indescribable air of seedy jauntiness, tilting
his soiled hat, swathing his neck in a bright kerchief,
and furnishing his body with a small-waisted
frock-coat.</p>

<p>It was very natural that Mrs. Parrot’s lodger should
be somewhat of a mystery to him. Having no liking
for children himself, but, on the contrary, a rather
decided aversion to them, he could not understand
what this Mr. Hampden saw in Nelly to make him so
prodigal in his gifts, so eager for her society.</p>

<p>Who <i>was</i> he? As Mrs. Parrot made a point of avoiding
him, he could not very well question her about her
lodger; but since she was the only person in Hanwitch
who was likely to know anything about him, he got one
of her tradesmen to cross-examine her. But this <i>ruse</i>
resulted in little. All that Mrs. Parrot could tell was,
that her lodger’s name was Hampden, that he was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
gentleman with rather queer habits, and that he seemed
to have lots of money.</p>

<p>It was something to find out that he had lots of money.</p>

<p>On the strength of this Mr. Conway suddenly discovered
Nelly to be a very interesting child, and never
seemed more pleased than when she was over the way
at Mrs. Parrot’s.</p>

<p>The fact was, the dentist had an idea. It was a
small, contemptible, tricky idea, such as poverty and
drink would beget between them. He kept it to himself
and waited.</p>

<p>Dolly, of course, was deeply gratified by Mr. Hampden’s
affection for her child. At first her curiosity had
been morbidly excited by this stranger. Something
there had been in his voice which stirred memory to its
centre: and the strange, baffling, elusive thoughts it
had induced kept her spiritless and nervous for some
days after the interview between them. Twice she
dreamed of the husband she believed dead. The dream,
in both instances, was perplexed, and left no determinable
impression; but its iteration increased her melancholy,
and made memory painful and importunate.</p>

<p>She accounted for her feelings by referring them to
the recollections which had been abruptly renewed&mdash;dragged,
so to say, from the grave in which they lay
hidden; and this clue being put into her hand, left her
easy as to the <i>raison d’être</i> of her depression.</p>

<p>Indeed, no suspicion of this stranger’s identity with
Holdsworth could have entered her mind without being
instantly followed by conviction. The thought never
occurred to her: how <i>could</i> it? She believed him dead,
and the permanent habit of this belief took the quality
of established proof of his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>But even if she had doubted his death; if ever she
had cherished the hope that he would one day return
to her&mdash;a hope that she had held to passionately for
awhile, but which had dropped dead out of her heart
when she gave her hand to Mr. Conway&mdash;no memory
that she had of him would admit the possibility of the
change that had been wrought in him.</p>

<p>There was a sign to be made&mdash;a look, a smile, a
whisper&mdash;which would flash perception into her, knit into
compact form the thoughts which his voice had troubled,
and confess him her <span class="smcap lowercase">HUSBAND</span>, though hollow-faced and
wan; though stricken as with age; though presenting
the ineffaceable memorials of grievous torture.</p>

<p>But, until this sign should be made, he must be a
stranger to her; a puzzle, perhaps; a man of eccentric
habits, and of an odd and striking aspect&mdash;but not her
husband.</p>

<p>Nor, strange as his suddenly-acquired affection for
Nelly might seem to others, could it come to her as a
surprise. The mother’s vanity would easily account for
the pleasure her little daughter gave to the lonely man.</p>

<p>Once, when Mrs. Parrot, meeting her in the road,
said that “It did seem strange that a man an’ a child, as
had niver set eyes on each other before, should love each
other in the way Mr. Hampden and Miss Nelly did:”
Dolly answered, “Yes; but though I am her mother,
yet I must say that Nelly is a pretty and very winning
child, and there is nothing uncommon in strangers taking
a fancy to children.”</p>

<p>No; that was quite true, Mrs. Parrot answered; and
told a story of a rich lady admiring a little beggar girl
in the street; and how the rich lady took the wench
into her carrich, and got the parients’ leaf to adopt her;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
and how the beggar girl came into the rich lady’s fortin,
and grew up into a stately an’ ’aughty woman, an’
married a lord, she did, as was beknown to many.</p>

<p>“It ’ud be a comfortin’ thing to you, ma’am, don’t
you think, if Mr. Hampden was to adopt your little gal.
It ’ud be a relief to your feelings, wouldn’t it?” Mrs.
Parrot said.</p>

<p>If some half-formed thought, bearing a resemblance
to Mrs. Parrot’s view, had flitted across Dolly’s mind,
let us not marvel. Never was her mood sadder, never
was her secret grief sharper, than when her child’s future
formed the subject of her thoughts. Who would give
Nelly a home if she died? Who would love the little
thing; rear her in the knowledge of God, of her broken-hearted
mother, of her poor drowned father?</p>

<p>“I could not part with her, Mrs. Parrot; she is the
only link that binds me to bygone happy days. I could
not spare her. My life would be <i>too</i> lonely for me to
support it. But I often pray to God that she may find a
friend&mdash;such a friend as I am sure Mr. Hampden would
make her&mdash;when I am dead.”</p>

<p>This hope&mdash;that Mr. Hampden <i>would</i> prove that
friend&mdash;was the real source of the comfort that filled her
heart each time she saw her little girl trip across to Mrs.
Parrot’s house.</p>

<p>She seldom saw Holdsworth. Sometimes she thought
he avoided her. Twice, when she was leaving or returning
to her house, she saw him in the porch, and
each time he hastily withdrew, when she would have
crossed over to speak to him. On rare occasions she
met him coming from the town. Once he raised his hat
and passed on: once she went up to him to thank him
for his kindness to Nelly. He answered her hurriedly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
speaking with an effort, and terminated the interview
almost abruptly by bowing and leaving her. Then,
again, his voice affected her powerfully. She stopped
and looked after him; and went on her way, brooding,
with a little frown of anxious, painful thought.</p>

<p>On his part, the weight of his secret, when they
thus met, face to face, was insupportable. The wild
rush of impulse combated by inflexible resolution,
created a conflict in his breast beyond his capacity of
endurance. He could not have prolonged a conversation
with her. It was shocking to feel himself unknown;
it was shocking to feel that he might betray himself.
But he could watch her from his window. He knew
now her hours of going and coming, and would station
himself behind the curtain, and follow her with exquisite
tenderness in his eyes, and sadness, crueller than words
can tell, in his heart.</p>

<p>How was this all to end?</p>

<p>Here was the thought that now tormented him.
Six weeks had passed since he came to Hanwitch. He
was living frugally, indeed; and of the money he had
brought with him from Australia a large portion still
remained. But his few hundred pounds made a very
slender capital; and when they were spent what then?</p>

<p>He knew very well that he could return to Sydney, that
Mr. Sherman would welcome him back, and reinstate
him in his old post. But the mere thought of leaving
England was misery to him. Suppose, under any plea,
he obtained Dolly’s leave to take Nelly with him, could
he part from Dolly? He might never see her again.
Then let him think of her companion; of the sordid,
hungry life he <i>knew</i> she was leading&mdash;knew, though he
could devise no expedient for relieving her, that might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
not be resented as an affront and lose him Nelly’s companionship.</p>

<p>He would rather have her in her grave than leave
her as she was.</p>

<p>If urgent distress should ever come upon her, he
would be at hand to succour and support her. And
that such urgent distress <i>must</i> come sooner or later&mdash;that
the day sooner or later <i>must</i> arrive when she and
her child would be without a home, he had but to
watch the maundering man who passed his windows
backwards and forwards day after day, aimless, sodden,
and growing shabbier and shabbier every week in his
appearance, to know.</p>

<span class="smaller">A VISIT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>How was Holdsworth to get a living? For what was
he fit? He was a good clerk; Mr. Sherman had called
him so, at least; Hanwitch was a tolerably large place,
and he ought to find no difficulty in obtaining employment.
At any rate, he must try.</p>

<p>One morning he put on his hat and walked into the
town.</p>

<p>When he reached the High Street, he stopped and
considered.</p>

<p>There was a bank; he could apply there. Then
there was a brewery. If these failed, there remained
an insurance office.</p>

<p>These represented polite avocations.</p>

<p>There were shops in abundance, where men, better
looking than he, smiled over counters, and carried parcels,
and stood bare-headed on the pavement at carriage-doors.
But Holdsworth was still too much the sailor at heart
to tolerate the notion of shop-serving. He would start
a little school rather than do that. And indeed school-keeping
seemed more feasible than anything else. Mrs.
Parrot’s lodgings would serve him there; boys would
assemble by degrees; and he could set and hear lessons,
and teach writing and mathematics, as well as any university
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, let him try the bank.</p>

<p>It faced the market-place in the High Street, had a
well-worn door-step and stout, noisy swinging doors.
Holdsworth entered, and found himself in a badly-lighted
office, with a counter across it, behind which
were three or four clerks. A man who looked a fourth-rate
farmer was paying money in, and whilst he counted
a great accumulation of greasy silver, which he had discharged
in company with a number of soiled, infragrant
cheques out of a leather bag, he paused at every twenty
to submit an observation of a rural nature to the intelligence
of an elderly personage with long whiskers, and
a somewhat Hebraical cast of visage, behind the counter.</p>

<p>The manager, for so the long-whiskered man was,
observing Holdsworth to be a stranger, politely asked
him his business.</p>

<p>“Can I speak to the manager?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir; <i>I</i> am the manager. Walk this way,
please.”</p>

<p>Saying which, the manager bustled importantly into
a back room, and threw open a side door for Holdsworth
to enter.</p>

<p>“Pray be seated, sir. Nice weather.”</p>

<p>And the manager drew a chair to a desk, clasped his
hands on a volume of interest-tables, and fixed his eyes
on Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“I have called to inquire if you are in want of a
clerk,” said Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?” exclaimed the manager.</p>

<p>Holdsworth repeated his remark, adding that he was
in want of a situation, and would be glad to fill any
vacancy there might be in the staff of the bank clerks.</p>

<p>The manager, who had expected something very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
different from this, got up instantly; his business-smile
vanished, he thrust his hands into his breeches pockets,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Clerk, sir! Who told you we wanted a clerk?”</p>

<p>“Nobody. I have called here at my own suggestion.”</p>

<p>“God bless my heart! You are quite out of order,
sir! Really, these intrusions upon my time .... you
should have explained your wish at the counter. When
we want a clerk, we know where to find one, backed,
sir, with first-class securities and influential recommendations.”</p>

<p>“Then I have made a mistake, that’s all,” said Holdsworth,
surveying the manager with great disgust; and
paying no further heed to the protests with which the
other followed him to the door, he walked into the High
Street.</p>

<p>This summary treatment was enough to last him one
day. His indignation yielded to depression, and he returned
slowly and moodily to his lodgings.</p>

<p>This was the first time in his life he had ever made
an application for employment; and his reception, which
was really genteel and civil compared to the receptions
experienced by men, old and young, every day, in search
of work, at the hands of employers, wounded his sensibility
and filled him with a sense of degradation.</p>

<p>He regained his lodgings, and endeavoured to console
himself with philosophy.</p>

<p>But philosophy, says Rochefoucauld, triumphs over
future and past ills; but present ills triumph over
philosophy.</p>

<p>His sensibility did not smart the less because he reflected
that hundreds of better men than himself had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
been insulted by rejections as offensive as that with which
his inquiry had been encountered.</p>

<p>Thoughts of something tender and innocent will often
quell the stubbornest warmth. Holdsworth grew mild
in a moment when his mind went to little Nelly.</p>

<p>“I’ll try the brewery to-morrow,” he said to himself;
“and if that fails me, I’ll advertise for a situation; and
if nothing comes of that, I’ll start a school.”</p>

<p>Thus thinking he walked to the window, hoping to
see his child in the road.</p>

<p>Nobody was visible but the old politician with the
inflamed face, who was pacing slowly along the pavement,
his hands locked behind him, his eyes bent downwards,
and his brow frowning grimly. Presently, Holdsworth
knew, the other old politician, who lived at the
corner house, would come out, and there would be much
gesticulation, and violent declamation, and frequent
pauses, and moppings of the forehead with red silk
pocket-handkerchiefs. Rain had fallen in the night,
and cleansed the little gardens in front of the villas of
the three weeks’ accumulation of dust that had settled
upon them, and freshened up the leaves and grass. In
the bit of ground before Mrs. Parrot’s house the flowers
had withered on their stalks, but the shrubs still wore
the bright greenness of summer; the soil was dark and
rich with the grateful moisture, and breathed a fragrance
of its own upon the morning air.</p>

<p>Holdsworth was about to quit the window when he
caught sight of Mr. Conway coming out of his gate.
He fell a step back, and watched the man from behind
the curtain. Mr. Conway advanced a few yards along
his own side of the road, and then crossed, with his
eyes fixed on Holdsworth’s window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>Was he coming to the house? He moved softly and
furtively, and when he was abreast of Mrs. Parrot’s gate,
threw a glance behind him, pushed the gate open, and
knocked.</p>

<p>As Holdsworth did not know the man to speak to,
he did not for a moment suppose that this visit was
meant for him. Much was he surprised, and even
agitated, when Mrs. Parrot came in and said that Mr.
Conway was in the passage, and would like to see him.</p>

<p>The first idea that rushed into Holdsworth’s head
was, “I am known!” But conjectures were out of the
question, for the man was waiting. “Pray show Mr.
Conway in,” he said; and in Mr. Conway came.</p>

<p>Holdsworth bowed, and so did the other, with a kind
of spasmodic grace&mdash;a good bow spoiled by nervousness.
He had dressed himself with care; he was cleanly
shaved; his hair was carefully brushed; his shirt collars
were white; and his boots shone.</p>

<p>Holdsworth had never before seen him so close.
The light from the window fell upon his face and
showed the cobweb of veins in his eyes, the puffy
whiteness of his skin, the blueness of his lips, the tinge
of gleaming purple about his nostrils, and all the other
signals which the alcoholic fiend stamps upon the countenances
of his votaries, so that, let them go where they
will, they may be known and loathed by honest men as
his adopted children.</p>

<p>But he was sober now; as sober as a man can be
who has drunk but a glass of ale since he left his bed,
but whose flesh is soaked with the abomination of the
taverns, and whose brain can never be steady for the
fumes that rise incessantly into it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hampden, I believe?” he exclaimed in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
creamy voice, standing near the door, which Mrs. Parrot
had shut behind him, and twisting his hat in his hands.</p>

<p>“Yes; pray be seated,” replied Holdsworth, looking
at him steadily, certain now that the object of this visit
was not what he had imagined it.</p>

<p>Mr. Conway sat down, and put his hat on the floor.
His embarrassment, when his business should come to
be known, might show a possibility of redemption, or at
least satisfy us that most of the bad qualities he was
accredited with might have been absorbed into his
nature with the drink he swallowed. No thoroughly
bad man could feel the nervousness that disturbed
him.</p>

<p>“I have called, Mr. Hampden, to thank you, for your
kindness to my little step-daughter. Indeed, sir, both
my wife and myself thoroughly appreciate your goodness.
Believe us, we do.”</p>

<p>“Pray do not trouble to thank me. She is a sweet
child, and it makes me happy to have her,” answered
Holdsworth, now at his ease, and studying his visitor
with curiosity and surprise.</p>

<p>“Ah! she is indeed a sweet child. A perfect treasure
to her mother, and quite a little sunbeam in my
house&mdash;darkened, I regret to say, by misfortunes beyond
my control to repair.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that.”</p>

<p>“I never can sufficiently deplore having adopted so
ungrateful a vocation as dentistry. I was born to better
things, Mr. Hampden. My father had an influential
position under Government; but he died in poverty,
and I was apprenticed by an uncle ... pray forgive
me. These matters cannot interest you. Privations
press heavily upon a man at my time of life. Dentistry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
seems to fail me; and yet, when I look around, I find
no other calling which I am qualified to espouse.”</p>

<p>He sighed, and pulled out a pocket-handkerchief,
with which he wiped his mouth.</p>

<p>Holdsworth was silent.</p>

<p>“Poverty I could endure, were I alone in the world,”
continued Mr. Conway; “but it is unendurable to me to
witness the best of women and the dearest of little
children in want. My poor wife does not complain;
but I witness her secret sufferings in her wasting form
and irrepressible tears, and it goes to my heart, sir, to
see her, and feel my miserable incapacity to relieve her.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that she is actually in want?”
exclaimed Holdsworth in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; we all are. As I hope to be saved, I
haven’t more than two shillings in the wide world!”</p>

<p>“Have you no source of income outside your profession?”</p>

<p>“No. I did well in the High Street; but I had
many rivals and enemies, who spread lying reports about
me, and lost me my best patients. Give a dog a bad
name! I left my establishment in the heart of the
town, and came into this road because rent was cheap
here; and God knows if I can tell how I have lived
since,” he cried passionately, his natural bad temper
breaking through his affectation of suffering and ill-treatment.
“The pawnbroker has been my only friend!
Am I to sell the bed from under me? Oh, sir, I think
of my wife, of my poor little child&mdash;for my child she is,
if love can make her so&mdash;and the thought is death to
me!”</p>

<p>He flourished his handkerchief and looked piteously
at Holdsworth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>“How can I serve you?”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir!” exclaimed Mr. Conway, sinking his voice
into a yet more whining note, the while a gleam entered
into his eyes; “what right have I to trespass upon the
benevolence of a stranger? of a gentleman who has
already placed me under a thousand obligations by his
kindness to my little daughter? I feel myself a wretch,
sir, when I reflect upon the unfortunate position I have
placed my poor wife in. I was flourishing in those days;
I could have given&mdash;I <i>did</i> give her and her baby a good
home. But what position is so secure that it can stand
against the lies of rivalry and jealousy? the slanderous
reports of ruffians who make capital for themselves out
of a neighbour’s trifling errors, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh! damn
them!”</p>

<p>“How can I serve you?” said Holdsworth, coming
quietly back to the point.</p>

<p>“If I dare name my wants to you, sir&mdash;if I dare
presume upon that benevolence which you have so signally
illustrated in your behaviour to little Nelly, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I am a poor man,” said Holdsworth, as the other
paused; “and can afford but little. But that little is
cheerfully at the service of your wife and child, who
must not be allowed to want.”</p>

<p>He spoke emphatically, to let the man understand
the purpose to which he intended his gift or loan should
be applied.</p>

<p>“But for that wife and child, sir,” answered Mr.
Conway, apparently struggling with his emotion, “<i>could</i>
I place myself in this position? Is there any personal
necessity, however imperative, that would force me to
lose sight of the pride which renders starvation prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>able
to alms-seeking, to the gentleman born? No, sir,”
he continued, with an air of injured dignity; “poor as I
am, I can still recognise the claims of my birth upon
my actions; and I repeat, that were it not for my wife
and her little one, no affliction, however unsupportable,
should oblige me to intrude even upon <i>your</i> benevolence.”</p>

<p>He paused, and seeing Holdsworth look impatient,
exclaimed hurriedly:</p>

<p>“If ten pounds&mdash;&mdash;” and stopped.</p>

<p>“You wish to borrow ten pounds?”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, if I dare&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of what service will so small a sum be to you?”</p>

<p>The man looked struck; Holdsworth had expected
to hear a larger sum named, he thought.</p>

<p>“Ten pounds&mdash;to a poor man&mdash;to a poor family, sir,
ten pounds is a great deal of money.”</p>

<p>“I will lend you ten pounds willingly, on condition
that you spend it on your wife and Nelly.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, certainly,” replied Mr. Conway meekly.
“You may depend upon being repaid, if I have to pawn
the shirt off my back to get the money.”</p>

<p>I suppose that this kind of security (generally offered
by men who have not the least idea of repaying a loan)
must be figurative&mdash;a poetical figure of debt. How far
would the shirt off a man’s back help the redemption of
the debts borrowed on the strength of it?</p>

<p>Holdsworth gave Mr. Conway two five-pound notes.
The man took them eagerly, and whilst he buried them
in his trousers’ pocket, poured forth a profusion of
thanks.</p>

<p>“Does Mrs. Conway know of this visit?” asked
Holdsworth, stopping his noise.</p>

<p>“No, sir; but believe me, I shall not fail to acquaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
her with your kindness,” he answered, taking his hat
and rising.</p>

<p>Holdsworth’s impulse was to request him not to speak
to her of this gift&mdash;for loan it would be ridiculous to
call it. But he checked himself with the consideration
that, were Mr. Conway to break his word, Dolly would
find food for dangerous questioning in the request.</p>

<p>He said, instead, “You will not forget the purpose for
which I have lent you this money?”</p>

<p>“Trust me, sir; trust me,” murmured Mr. Conway,
pressing his hat to his heart. “If you will give me ink
and paper I will make you out an I O U at once.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that. Nelly is a growing child, and
requires nourishing food: devote the money to her and
her mother, and you will make me grateful.”</p>

<p>He walked into the passage, and Mr. Conway, bowing
humbly, passed into the porch, where he stood a moment
or two peeping at his house; then, with another bow,
hurried into the road, and vanished in the direction of
the town.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The poverty of the Conways, then, was unquestionable.
Holdsworth had often speculated upon their
position, but had never reached nearer to the mark than
supposing that they lived from hand to mouth, and just
made shift to support the day that was passing over
them. That they were actually in want, actually
destitute indeed, it had never entered his mind to imagine.
He believed Conway’s story. And it was very
certain that, if the man had no private means of his
own, he must be hopelessly poor, for he made nothing
by his profession. In all the six weeks that Holdsworth
had been in Hanwitch he had not seen as many people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
call at Conway’s house; and of these, supposing them to
be patients, half of them had come away after speaking
with the servant, doubtless informed that master was out.</p>

<p>But even guessing so much, Holdsworth guessed only
half the truth: and it was well, perhaps, that he did
not know all, for grief must have mastered his judgment,
and forced him into the confession which he prayed,
night and morning, for will to restrain. It was after
dark always when Dolly, closely veiled, would creep
down the road, with some little bundle under her shawl,
for the pawnbroker, that she might obtain a trifle in
order to furnish her child with a meal on the morrow.
It was in the privacy of her own home that she laboured,
as no menial ever <i>will</i> labour; sitting up late night after
night, over the endless task of darning and mending her
own and her child’s shabby apparel; often going supperless
to bed, and waking to a day even more hopeless than
the one that had preceded it.</p>

<p>The devoted man, who would have given his life to
win her happiness, knew nothing of all this. Even his
little child’s dress told him no story, though a woman
might have read a full and pathetic narrative of toil and
poverty in the frock, turned and re-turned, mended and
patched, and darned again and again.</p>

<p>Holdsworth seldom saw her now: yet, if ever she
caught sight of him at his window, she had always a
kindly smile, a grateful nod: and what with the shadow
of her hat over her face, and the distance which softened
the lines of care, grief, and weariness into the sweet and
delicate effect of her beauty, he was ignorant of the
serious and withering change that had taken place in
her, even during the short time that had elapsed since
they had last met and spoken in the High Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Nelly came over to him at one o’clock, and he kept
her to dinner. The child was hungry, and as he
watched her eating, he thought of Dolly.</p>

<p>“Has mamma got a good dinner to-day, darling?”</p>

<p>The little thing looked puzzled; but upon Holdsworth
repeating the question, answered “Noo.”</p>

<p>He thought she was mistaken, since, after what Conway
had told him, the man’s first action, he believed,
now that he had money in his pocket, would be to attend
to his wife’s necessities. But though he repeated
his question in different shapes, the child invariably
answered, “Noo, mamma got no din-din.”</p>

<p>“No dinner at all! Are you sure, my pet?”</p>

<p>Yes, the child was sure, as sure as a child could be.</p>

<p>Holdsworth sprang up and rang the bell, and entered
the passage to await Mrs. Parrot. She came out of
her kitchen, and Holdsworth exclaimed, mastering his
agitation:</p>

<p>“I want to confer with you, Mrs. Parrot. Nelly tells
me that her mamma has no dinner to-day. Is this
likely&mdash;is this possible, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, sir, since you ask me, I do then, and God
forgi’ me for thinkin’ the worst,” answered Mrs. Parrot.</p>

<p>“But,” cried Holdsworth, “I gave Mr. Conway ten
pounds this morning, stipulating that he should spend
it on his wife and child!”</p>

<p>“He!” exclaimed Mrs. Parrot, almost savagely.
“The wretch! ten pounds! he’ll spend it all i’ liquor!
Oh, sir, why didn’t you give it to the poor lady?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;I ought to have done so,” replied Holdsworth
clasping his hands. “But how could I&mdash;what excuse
<i>could</i> I have found for sending it to her? Oh, Mrs.
Parrot! something must be done. I can’t bear to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
of the poor lady actually dinnerless. What can we contrive?
Remember&mdash;she is a lady&mdash;we must be careful.”</p>

<p>“To think of your lending ten pounds to that villin!”
cried Mrs. Parrot, whose mind was staggered by the
munificence of the sum and the artfulness of the man in
obtaining it. “I niver heerd of such a thing! And
was that his reason for callin’? If I’d ha’ only known
his object, I’d ha’ sent him packin’ with his blarney,
wouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“What do you advise?” said Holdsworth, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I’m sure I don’t know what to say. She
<i>is</i> a lady, and it wouldn’t do to send her butchers’ meat
across, would it? I’ll tell you what we <i>could</i> do, sir;
I could kill one o’ my fowls and leave it with my compliments,
pretending I had killed some yesterday, and
wished her, as a neighbour, to taste my fattening.”</p>

<p>“That will do! But, instead of killing your fowls,
take this half-sovereign and run at once to the poulterer’s,
and buy a couple of pullets. You can then take them
across, and she will suppose they are your own rearing.
Will you do this?”</p>

<p>“With the greatest of pleasure, sir; and I’m sure you
must have a very kind heart to take so much interest
in poor folks.”</p>

<p>And Mrs. Parrot ran off for her bonnet, and was
presently hurrying down the road with a market-basket
on her arm, and her untied bonnet-strings streaming
over her shoulders.</p>

<p>Holdsworth waited impatiently for her return, whilst
Nelly, who had finished dinner, toddled about the room,
gazing with round earnest eyes into the recesses, and
the cupboards, and at the shepherds on the mantelpiece,
and the yellow roses on the mat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>In ten minutes’ time Mrs. Parrot came back with
her face flushed with the heat and exercise, and darted
into the house as though she had swept half a jeweller’s
shop into her basket and was flying for dear life.</p>

<p>“There, sir, what do you think of these?” she exclaimed,
dragging a pair of handsomely-floured pullets
out of the basket and holding them at arm’s length, as
though they were a pair of ear-rings. “Aren’t they
beauties, sir?”</p>

<p>“How can I send them across? Will you take
them?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes. I can jest leave ’em at the door wi’ Mrs.
Parrot’s compliments. She’ll be sure to guess that
they’re my rearin’, and save me from an untruth,
though my religion is none so fine, thank God, that I
should be afeard to tell a kind o’ white lie to help any
poor creature as wanted.”</p>

<p>She then examined the pullets attentively, to make
sure that there were no trade-marks upon them in the
shape of tickets, adjusted her bonnet, wiped her face,
and walked across the road.</p>

<p>Holdsworth waited in the passage until she returned.
She was absent a few minutes, and then came back
smiling, with the lid of the basket raised to let Holdsworth
see that it was empty.</p>

<p>“Did you see Mrs. Conway?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I wouldn’t ask for her,” replied Mrs.
Parrot, wiping her feet on the door-mat. “I jest says
to the gal, ‘Give this here to your missis with my compliments,
and tell her that they’re ready for cookin’ at
once, as they’re been killed long enough.’ I niver see
any gal look like that wench did when she took the
pullets. I thought she’d ha’ fainted. She turned as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
pale as pale, and then she grinned slow-like, and then
laughed wi’ a sound for all the world like the squeak of
a dog that’s smotherin’ under a cushion. Here’s your
change, sir. Pullets, six shillin’, and one is seven, and
two is nine, and two sixpences makes it right. Will
you please to count it?”</p>

<p>Holdsworth thanked her, and returned to the sitting-room
with a relieved mind. But scarcely was he seated
when Mrs. Parrot knocked on the door, and mysteriously
beckoned him into the passage.</p>

<p>“I forgot to say, sir, that I ast the gal before
coming away if her master was in, and she said ‘No.’
I says, ‘When will he be in?’ She says, ‘I don’t know,
missis; he went out this mornin’, an’ he’s not been back
since.’ Mark what I say, sir!” added Mrs. Parrot,
raising an emphatic forefinger, “he’ll not give a penny
o’ that money to his poor wife, but jest keep away from
her till he’s drunk it all out.”</p>

<p>Accompanying which prophecy with many indignant
nods, she walked defiantly towards the kitchen.</p>

<p>The idea of Dolly’s miserable position, never before
impressed upon him as it had been that day, made
Holdsworth wretched. He seated himself at the window
and stared gloomily and sadly into the road. Nelly
came to him and tried to coax him to play with her,
but he had no heart even to meet the little creature’s
sweet entreating eyes with a smile. He caught her up,
pressed her to him, and kissed her again and again,
while the hot tears rolled down his thin face.</p>

<p>Never before was his impulse to tell Dolly who he
was and snatch her from the misery, the unmeet sorrow
that encompassed her, so powerful. Love and pity
strove with the dread of dishonouring her by the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>velation.
Could he endure to think that this delicate,
gentle girl was linked to a man who neglected her, who
might even ill-treat her, who at that moment might be
squandering the money that had been given him on his
own gross appetites, without thought of the wife and
child wanting bread at home? What must be the issue
of such a life if it were permitted to endure? Sooner
or later Holdsworth must avow himself to save her and
his child from that uttermost degree of ruin and misery
to which Conway was dragging them.</p>

<p>He had hoped to devote his life to them. His dream
had been that Conway’s character was not irretrievably
bad, that kindly entreaty, cordial advice, and pecuniary
help might bring him to a knowledge of his folly and
set him once more on the high-road to respectability.
Such a redemption would have been Holdsworth’s sacrifice;
but his own happiness was as nothing in his eyes
compared to Dolly’s. Faithfully would he have performed
his duty to her, nobly would he have vindicated
his own most honourable, most exalted devotion, could
he have reclaimed this erring man and taught him to
give his wife as much happiness as it was possible for a
heart that ceaselessly mourned a dead love, to know.
Thus he could have been his Dolly’s good angel, and
whilst God permitted him, have kept watch over her
and her child, dead to her belief, but active as the holiest
love could make life in his helpful secret guardianship.</p>

<p>He perceived the vanity of that hope now, and yet
despairingly clung to it, because, if he surrendered it,
he felt that he must confess himself, and from this he
shrank as from a deed that would inflict a deeper degradation
upon her, while Conway lived, than any she
could suffer from her husband’s behaviour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>One must either entirely sympathise with his profound
susceptibility of the obligation his supposed death had
forced upon him to fulfil, or ridicule him as a man
absurdly fantastical in his views of morality. There
seems no middle standpoint to judge him from.</p>

<p>But unless there be too much austerity in his virtue
to make it admirable, then, to properly appreciate it,
we must remember the extraordinary tenderness of his
nature, his exquisite sensibility, which shrank from the
mere thought of tarnishing the pure honour of the
woman he loved.</p>

<p>That he believed her honour would be tarnished
were he to proclaim himself in the lifetime of her present
husband, was enough; and whether he was right
or wrong; whether he was correct in holding the obligations
of the marriage-service holy, binding, and to be
disturbed only at the risk of God’s wrath, when incurred
with a spotless conscience, when entered upon in innocence
and good faith; or whether he should have
regarded the marriage-service as a mere civil convention
which made his wife his property, claimable by him on
the common ground of the law of priority, without
reference to any action she might have committed in
honest belief that he was dead; one thing we must
allow him&mdash;an unparalleled quality of unselfishness, the
existence of which, while it attested the sincerity of his
views (since he had his heart’s deepest affections to lose
and nothing to gain by retaining them), elevated his
conduct to the highest point of heroism.</p>

<p>Nelly had never before found him unwilling to romp
with her; when he raised his head she watched his face
with a strange, wistful look, and putting her finger to
his cheek, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why do ’oo cry?”</p>

<p>He forced a smile for answer, caressed her, and then
placed her on the ground, thinking she was weary of
sitting. But she climbed upon his knee again, and
repeated her question with great earnestness:</p>

<p>“Why do ’oo cry?”</p>

<p>“Because I am silly and weak, my little one. I am
forgetting that there is a good and just God over me,
who will hear my prayers and help me, as He before
did, when I was alone on the wide sea.”</p>

<p>He said this aloud, but spoke rather to himself than
to the child.</p>

<p>“Dod loves Nelly,” said the little thing, “and Nelly
loves ’oo. Nelly kiss ’oo.”</p>

<p>That was all the comfort she could give him; but it
fell tenderly on his ear. He kissed her gratefully, rocking
her gently to and fro in his arms with his eyes on
her face. She soon, however, rebelled against an attitude
which crippled her limbs, and slipped on to the
floor, and to amuse her he gave her a book with pictures
in it, which she examined gravely, talking to herself as
little children and aged people do.</p>

<p>In this manner the afternoon passed; but never was
Holdsworth more depressed, more restless, filled with
more nameless anxieties and misgivings.</p>

<p>Apart from all moral considerations, his future was
terribly uncertain.</p>

<p>Suppose the Conways left the town? He must
follow them, for he could not bear the separation; and
what would they think of his pursuit? Suppose all
his efforts to obtain a living failed, what should he
do?</p>

<p>At five o’clock Mrs. Parrot came in to put on Nelly’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
hat: that was the regular hour at which the little girl
was sent home by Holdsworth.</p>

<p>“My apron is dirty,” said the worthy woman, “so
I’ll not go across with you, my dear. But I’ll watch
from the porch until I see you safe in.”</p>

<p>So, receiving a kiss and a piece of gingerbread from
Holdsworth, the child toddled into the road, and when
she was inside the gate, where her mother would see
her, Mrs. Parrot closed the door and went back to her
ironing in the kitchen.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE KNOT IS CUT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>A storm broke over Hanwitch that night, and left behind
it a strong wind which swept up great masses of clouds;
and the morning sunshine streamed and darkened in
quick alternations, and made the air lively with the
movement of shadow.</p>

<p>Holdsworth, deeply disturbed by conflicting anxieties,
had slept but little; and at eight o’clock left his bed and
started for a walk before breakfast, hoping that the
breeze which thundered about the house would freshen
and inspirit him.</p>

<p>Gaining the High Street, he turned to the left and
walked along a narrow pathway that took him through
the fields to Maldon Heights, as the hill that overlooked
Hanwitch was called. He climbed the grassy slope and
stood awhile on the summit, drinking in the hooting
wind and watching the fluctuating scene that ran from
his feet to the horizon. The oats and barley in many
fields were not yet cut; and it was a sight to see them
breaking into wide spaces of delicate gold under the sun,
and growing gray again as the cloud-shadows sailed over
them. When the sunshine lingered awhile, these fields
seemed to reflect the shadows which had passed, for the
wind rushed like a dark arm along them, and pressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the graceful grain into the likeness of a wave, which
swept forwards with swiftness, making the fields dark
where it ran. The farther trees appeared to hold steady
under the breeze; but there were nearer trees which
swayed their branches in wild gesticulations of entreaty,
and flogged the wind as it roared among them, bearing
away trophies of green leaves and broken twigs. The
birds breasted the gale with short flights, or turned and
yielded to the invisible power with small cries. Every
object the eye rested on appeared in motion, so lively
was the effect of the cloud shadows upon the houses and
the weight of the wind upon the surrounding country.</p>

<p>It was a morning to clear the most hypochondriacal
mind of despondency, and Holdsworth felt its cheerful
influence as he stood exposed to the swinging rush of
warm air, and watched nature dancing to the tunes
sung by the wind as it swept through the sky.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind to call at the brewery
that morning, and he took a look at it as he passed the
street in which it stood on his way home. The gaol-like
building, with the steam about its windows resembling
rich London fog, which refused either to stop in or go
away, was scarcely calculated to improve his hopes.
Big beef-faced men in aprons rolled huge casks out of a
courtyard into a cellar filled with sawdust, damp, and
gloom; the throb of the engine could be heard distinctly,
and the wind that blew out of the street came in agitated,
disordered puffs, as though the smell of the beer had
made it rather drunk.</p>

<p>Holdsworth shook his head as he passed on. It
struck him that there would be little chance of his
getting employment in that steaming, panting, perspiring
quarter; and that he would be acting more wisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
if, instead of challenging rudeness by personal inquiries
at places where nobody wanted him, he spent a few
shillings in advertising for a situation.</p>

<p>Determining to do this, he made what haste he could
back to his lodgings, meaning there and then to manufacture
an advertisement.</p>

<p>He entered his sitting-room, rang the bell to let Mrs.
Parrot know he had returned, and sat himself down to
consider the terms in which he should make his wants
known.</p>

<p>“What would you like for breakfast, sir?” said Mrs.
Parrot, opening the door.</p>

<p>“Oh, anything you please. A new-laid egg if you
can find me one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I took four beauties out just now. Have
you heard the news, sir?”</p>

<p>“No. What news?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it’s what I allus thought must happen;
and day after day I’ve bin expectin’ it, as mother’ll bear
me out. They’ve got the brokers in at the Conways.”</p>

<p>“The brokers!” exclaimed Holdsworth, turning round
in his chair quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Their gal told the milkman just now, as
giv’ me the news. And what’s wuss&mdash;leastways some
might call it wuss, though I should consider it a good
job myself if I was his wife&mdash;Mr. Conway hasn’t been
home all night!”</p>

<p>“The villain!” exclaimed Holdsworth through his
teeth. And then he jumped up and began to pace the
room excitedly.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he cried, observing that Mrs. Parrot was
about to withdraw. “Are you sure this news is true?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve no doubt of it, sir. When the milkman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
told me, I was jest goin’ to run across and see the poor
lady, and then I says to myself, ‘What use can I be
to her?’”</p>

<p>“I may be of some use, though,” interrupted Holdsworth.
“Never mind about my breakfast just yet.
When did the man enter the house to take possession?”</p>

<p>“Last night, sir, the gal told the milkman.”</p>

<p>“Great heaven! And has she been alone all night?”
He stopped short, seized his hat, and, brushing past
Mrs. Parrot, went quickly out of the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot watched him from the porch, lost in
amazement.</p>

<p>He pushed open the gate, marched up to the door,
and knocked loudly. His mood was one of deep excitement.
The sense of the crushing misery that had fallen
upon Dolly had given a poignancy to feeling that set
all self-control at defiance.</p>

<p>The door was opened by the servant, and out with
her came a smell of strong tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Conway in?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he ain’t,” answered the girl, looking behind
her and then at Holdsworth, with a scared face.</p>

<p>“Where’s your mistress?”</p>

<p>“In the parlour, sir.”</p>

<p>“I should like to see her.”</p>

<p>“She’s not wisible. She’s in grief, and ain’t to be
seen.”</p>

<p>“Go and tell her that Mr. Hampden has called and
would like to say a word to her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Do what I tell you!” exclaimed Holdsworth.</p>

<p>The girl slouched backwards and pushed her head
into the parlour-door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>“She ain’t here. She’s gone upstairs,” said she, and
upstairs she went, slapping the staircase with her shoes
as she went.</p>

<p>An individual with a round red face, a white hat, a
spotted shawl, a coat nearly to his ankles, a long waistcoat,
and a black clay pipe in his mouth, lounged elegantly
out of the room which Mr. Conway had called
his “Surgery” at the end of the passage, and leaning
collectedly against the door, nodded familiarly to Holdsworth,
took his pipe from his mouth, expectorated, and
said “Morning.”</p>

<p>“Good morning. Are you the man in possession?”
replied Holdsworth.</p>

<p>The individual nodded and replaced his pipe.</p>

<p>“When did you come?”</p>

<p>“Last night,” answered the man in a thick voice.
“And a werry queer look-out it is. Blowed if they’ve
got any butter in this house!”</p>

<p>“What is the amount of the debt?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-three pun four and sevenpence,” said the
man, removing his pipe to expectorate again. “Are
you a creditor?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Holdsworth, listening for Dolly’s
footsteps.</p>

<p>“Then if you vent on your bended knees for gratitood
you vouldn’t be overdoin’ it,” said the man, giving
Holdsworth a sagacious nod. “There ain’t above ten
pound in the house, and not that. Cast yer eye into
that parler. The best of the goods is there, and if you
can make three pound out of ’em, I’ll swaller my pipe.”</p>

<p>And then an idea smiting him:</p>

<p>“You ain’t come to have a tooth drawed, have yer?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>“Vot’s your opinion of tooth-drawin’?” inquired the
man confidentially, retiring and reappearing again, holding
up a pair of forceps. “Ain’t it rayther a queer go,
don’t you think? I knew a barber as drawed teeth.
He never used nothing of this kind. Vot do you think
he did? Bust me if he doesn’t set you in a chair,
fastens a bit o’ vire to the tooth as is to come out, and
ties t’other end of the vire to the leg of a table. Ven
all’s ready, ‘Mind yer eye’ he sings out, ups with a
razor, rushes at yer makin’ horrible mouths, up jumps
you, avays you run, and leaves your tooth behind yer!”</p>

<p>He gargled an asthmatical laugh, adding: “That’s
vot I call a sensible vay of drawin’ a tooth; no bits of
cold iron shoved into yer mouth as if yer tongue vas
hair and vanted curling.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, will you step into the parlour and sit
down,” said the girl, thrusting her head over the banisters
and calling to Holdsworth. “Missis’ll be with
yer in a minute.”</p>

<p>He entered the wretched little parlour, while the
“man in possession” retreated to the surgery arm-chair,
and sat severely contemplating some unfinished teeth
on the table in front of him.</p>

<p>In a few moments Holdsworth heard footsteps outside,
and Dolly came in, holding Nelly’s hand. She
was terribly pale, with a look of terror and exhaustion
on her face painful to see. There was an unnatural
sleepless brilliancy in her eyes that heightened her worn,
hopeless expression. She had thrown an old shawl over
her shoulders, and through the portion of the fair skin
of the neck that was exposed the veins showed dark.
The hand she gave to Holdsworth was like a stone.</p>

<p>He was so overcome by the sight of her misery, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
for some moments he could not speak. The child came
up to him and rubbed her cheek against his hand.</p>

<p>“This is kind, very kind of you, Mr. Hampden,” she
exclaimed in a low, faint voice, sinking upon the sofa
and shivering as she hugged the shawl about her
shoulders.</p>

<p>“You are in great distress, I fear. I only heard the
news just now. I came over to you at once,” he
answered tremulously, the fierce beating of his heart
sounding an echo through his voice.</p>

<p>“It is what I have been daily expecting for many
months&mdash;for many bitter, cruel months!” she exclaimed.
“It has come at last. We are homeless now. And my
husband, who ought to be at my side, has left me. He
was away all day yesterday and last night. O God!
what a night it has been!” she moaned, rocking herself
to and fro.</p>

<p>“Don’t say you are homeless,” he cried; “you have
a friend. Let me be your friend. Mrs. Parrot shall
give you a home for the present ... if you will accept
it.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with stupefied eyes as one who
doubts her senses, then said: “We have no claim upon
you. Oh! how noble-hearted! Nelly, Nelly, come to
me, come to me!”</p>

<p>The child ran to her mother, and, being frightened
by the passionate despair in her voice, hid her face in
her lap and burst into tears. But Dolly’s eyes remained
dry&mdash;lost nothing of their wild brilliancy. She dragged
her child to her, and swayed to and fro with tearless
sobs that shook and convulsed her.</p>

<p>“I have deserved this,” she presently moaned. “I
was faithless to the truest love God ever blessed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
woman with. Why was he taken from me? My child
was starving, and the sight of her wasted body drove
me mad with grief. I never loved Mr. Conway&mdash;he
knew it ... He has left me! Oh! he is a coward to
leave me! What am I to do? I am a lonely woman&mdash;I
have this child to feed and clothe&mdash;I have not a
relative to turn to&mdash;and now we are homeless! O
God! this is too much, too much!”</p>

<p>She hid her face in her child’s hair.</p>

<p>Nothing but the dread that the truth, at that
moment, might kill her to hear, prevented him, as he
listened to her heart-broken words, from kneeling to her
and calling her wife. He watched her with a strange
steadfastness of gaze, and with a face more bloodless
than hers. The impulse to avow himself had recoiled
and driven the blood to his heart; a faintness overcame
him, but he battled with the deadly weakness, and the
better to do so, rose and strode across the room and
stood near his wife and child, looking down upon them.</p>

<p>“I will help you to the utmost of my power,” he
said, speaking slowly, and with a difficulty that presently
passed. “Whilst I live, neither you nor your child will
be friendless. Trust me, and make me happy by knowing
me to be your friend.”</p>

<p>She raised her feverishly-lighted eyes, and said in a
quick, febrile whisper: “You cannot take the burden
of the three of us upon yourself.”</p>

<p>“No! I would not raise a finger to serve your
husband now. He has money, but he left you in want
all day yesterday, and you have been alone through the
night... But I will befriend you and your child.
Whatever I can do shall be done. I am not rich&mdash;I
would to God I were, for your sake. Were I to pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
this debt, I should only delay the loss of your furniture
for a few days; others would come, and I should not
have the money to deal with them.”</p>

<p>“What am I to do?” she wailed, clinging to her
child.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Parrot’s house will be your home for the
present. We must wait until we get news of Mr.
Conway.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Hampden, is he not cruel to have left me
in this position! No one knows but God what I have
endured during the last year! When I was battling
with poverty alone I was happier and richer. My
memories were fresh and pure, my conscience was clear,
but I sacrificed them for Nelly’s sake, and now I am deserted
and the most miserable woman in the whole
world!”</p>

<p>She broke into a long piteous cry, but no tears came
into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Let me take you at once from this wretched home.
Come!”</p>

<p>He went to the door and held it open. Dolly stared
around her like a sleeper suddenly aroused, and then
rose with the child in her arms. Holdsworth called to
the servant and told her to fetch her mistress’s hat.
The “man in possession” lounged out of the back room
and stared with a dry smile.</p>

<p>“Goin’?” he asked.</p>

<p>Holdsworth did not answer him. The weight of
the child was too great for the half-fainting mother,
who tottered as she stood. Holdsworth took Nelly
from her and placed her on the ground.</p>

<p>“You ain’t a goin’, missis, are yer?” said the servant,
handing Dolly the hat, and whimpering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Holdsworth; “and if Mr. Conway
should call, tell him that his wife is at Mrs. Parrot’s.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mum, I don’t like to be left alone with that
man!” cried the servant, looking down the passage.</p>

<p>“Vy not?” said the man. “If you’re all goin’, who’s
to cook my wittles, I should like to know?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i>’ll not stop!” exclaimed the girl. “I wouldn’t
trust myself anear him.”</p>

<p>“You’re free to stop or go, as you please,” said Holdsworth,
giving her some money.</p>

<p>“Then I ain’t to be paid out arter all?” exclaimed
the man, striking a match, and holding it flaming in one
hand and his pipe in the other.</p>

<p>“Not by me,” answered Holdsworth, opening the
hall-door.</p>

<p>He took Nelly’s hand and gave Dolly his arm. She
drew a long quivering sob as she passed through the
garden; and then, seeing some inquisitive faces staring
over the wire-blinds in the opposite house, hung her
head and stepped out quickly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot, hearing them come in, ran out of the
kitchen, and stood looking from one to the other of them
in mute astonishment.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Conway will make a temporary home of your
house, Mrs. Parrot,” said Holdsworth. “You will
kindly prepare a bed-room for her and Miss Nelly, and
place your drawing-room at her disposal.”</p>

<p>Dolly had sunk into a chair. He poured out some
wine and held it to her, but she waved it away, striving
to suppress her sobs.</p>

<p>“Oh, ma’am, pray don’t take on so,” cried Mrs. Parrot,
going up to her. “Things’ll come right, ma’am. You’ll
be heasy an’ comfortable here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>Holdsworth knelt on a chair beside her, holding the
wine. Oh, it was hard that he could not take her to
his heart and whisper the word that would change all
her anguish into joy. But if ever the barrier that was
raised between them had been felt, it was felt by him
then. Her honour now, more than ever it had been,
was become peculiarly his care. The sense of her being
another’s, that his own claims were as naught in the
presence of her belief that she was Conway’s wife, was
never before so sharply felt. Her misery had given her
in his eyes a sanctity that made his yearning love sacrilegious.
Humility conquered emotion, and he crept
away from her side, and stood looking at her from a
distance, holding Nelly’s hand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Parrot’s fingers were busy with
Dolly’s hat strings and the shawl over her shoulders,
and she murmured incessantly all manner of kindly sentences,
of which their extreme triteness as consolatory
axioms was greatly qualified by her motherly manner.</p>

<p>“There, my dear,” she exclaimed, laying the hat
upon the table, “drink a little wine: you’ll be better
presently. Life’s full o’ troubles, God knows! and there
are husbands in this world as is enough to make a
woman forget her sect and strike ’em. But a friend,
ma’am, is as good as sunshine to a frost-bitten man, and
I’m sure you’ve got a good and kind one in Mr. Hampden.”</p>

<p>“It’s my husband’s desertion,” cried Dolly, “that I
think of. I don’t mind the loss of my home. But to
think of <i>his</i> deserting me and my little one when he
<i>could</i> not know that I had a friend&mdash;when I married him
for Nelly’s sake, to get her bread. Yes, Mrs. Parrot, to
save her from starving. And to feel that I defied my
conscience only to be brought so low&mdash;<i>so</i> low!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>“God forbid, my dear, that iver <i>I</i> should set husband
an’ wife agin’ each other,” replied Mrs. Parrot, glancing
at Holdsworth, to see how he might relish her remark;
“but I <i>must</i> say that, if Mr. Conway’s left yer, it’s a
good thing, an’ the last thing on this airth as would
trouble me if I was you. You’ve gone through a deal
o’ sufferin’ for him, an’ if he’s desairted you, you can’t
come to worse harm nor was he to have stood by his
home like a man, which he niver was; and there’s not
one o’ your neighbours as don’t know that you’ve had
more trouble than any Christian woman i’ this world
ought to have. And it may sound a hard sayin’, but if
he’s gone,” she exclaimed, looking defiantly at Holdsworth,
“I hope and pray it’s for good an’ all.”</p>

<p>It often happens in real life, as in books, that a
closing remark will take a weird appropriateness by the
sudden confrontment of the fact of which it is only the
shadow. Mrs. Parrot had barely shut her mouth when
the passage echoed with the clattering of the knocker
on the house-door. Never was such a delirious knocking.
Mrs. Parrot turned pale, persuaded that Mr. Conway
had come home drunk, and had reeled across to her
house to demand his wife and create a horrible “scene.”</p>

<p>Dolly raised her head, and it was plain that the same
idea had occurred to her, by the indescribable expression
of mingled hate, fear, and loathing that entered her face.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot giving her moral organisation a twist,
ran out. Scarcely had she opened the door when in
burst Martha, the servant from over the way.</p>

<p>“Oh, missis! oh, missis!” she screeched, “what do
you think? Master’s drowned! O Lord! Where’s
Mrs. Conway? He’s dead an’ gone! Here’s the gent as
brought the noos. Oh, sir, please tell the missis here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>She turned, and in her excitement caught hold of
the sleeve of a little stout man who stood behind, and
literally dragged him forward.</p>

<p>“Let go, you fool! What are you a doing of? Are
you Mrs. Conway?” he asked of Mrs. Parrot, who stood
staring with wide-open eyes, grasping her dress as if
she were only waiting to take a deep breath before
tearing herself in two.</p>

<p>“No, she ain’t! This ain’t Mrs. Conway!” cried
the excited Martha.</p>

<p>“You told me she was here!” exclaimed the man.</p>

<p>“So she is; ain’t she, missis?”</p>

<p>“Great ’iven! what a clatterin’!” cried Mrs. Parrot,
recovering her tongue. “What is it you’ve got to say,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, this,” answered the little man, who was evidently
a very irritable little man&mdash;“Mr. Conway’s body
was found in the river this morning at a quarter before
seven, and he’s lying now in the Town Hall, and I’ve
come to give the news; and curse me if ever I’ll undertake
such a job again, if I am to be mauled about by
such a fool as this when I’m out of breath, and fit to
drop with perspiration.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Parrot! Mrs. Parrot!” called Holdsworth.</p>

<p>The half-distracted woman ran into the sitting-room,
where the first thing she saw was Dolly in a dead faint,
lying upon the sofa, with Holdsworth kneeling by her side.</p>

<p>“She overheard your voices!” he exclaimed, turning
up a face as white as death. “Pray God the shock
may not kill her. Look to her, Mrs. Parrot, I <i>must</i>
speak to the man outside.”</p>

<p>He jumped up and left the room, and found the little
irritable man in the act of walking away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>“I beg your pardon. One moment!” he cried, running
out after him. “Pray excuse my agitation&mdash;you
have brought shocking news. Is it <i>indeed</i> true?”</p>

<p>The little man turned and took in Holdsworth from
head to foot, and answered: “It is true, sir. I’ve seen
the body myself. It’s in the Town Hall. He’s been in
the water all night, the doctor says.”</p>

<p>“All night?”</p>

<p>“He was found by a man named Williamson. They
all knew who he was when they saw him. He must
have been drunk when he fell into the water, for the
path was wide enough for a horse and cart. Dr. Tanner
asked me to step round with the news as he heard I
was coming this way. Good morning.”</p>

<p>The little man nodded and walked away. Had
Dolly been a rich man’s wife, a sympathetic deputation,
introduced by the churchwardens, might have made a
procession to her house to break the news gently, but
how can you expect sympathy for the wife of a man
who dies owing everybody money?</p>

<p>Holdsworth was stunned, and stood for some moments
staring idly from the porch. He then returned hastily
to Dolly’s side.</p>

<p>“She’s comin’ to, sir,” said Mrs. Parrot, slapping the
poor girl’s hand, and expending what breath she had
upon the cold white forehead. “What awful noos, sir!...
Conway dead! I can’t believe it. And drowned,
too! Oh, poor wretch!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed Holdsworth.</p>

<p>Dolly had opened her eyes, and was staring blindly
at him. He moistened his handkerchief with water on
the sideboard and pressed it to her head. Nelly stood
at the window gazing at her mother with a look of wist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>ful
fear in her face. At the door was Martha’s countenance,
seamed with lines of perspiration, her mouth
open, and her hair hanging like a string of young carrots
over her forehead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I feel very weak,” muttered Dolly, striving to sit
upright, but falling back.</p>

<p>“Something terrible has happened. Ah! Robert
is dead!”</p>

<p>The memory rushed upon her like a spasm, and she
spoke in a cry.</p>

<p>“Come, my dear, don’t try to speak yet,” said Mrs.
Parrot.</p>

<p>“Where is Nelly?”</p>

<p>Holdsworth led the child to the sofa. The mother
looked at her little girl, opened her arms, and burst
into tears.</p>

<p>“Thank God for that!” said Holdsworth, turning
away. Watching her face as her consciousness had
dawned, he had felt that, if tears did not relieve her,
her heart would break.</p>

<span class="smaller">HUSBAND AND WIFE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The little irritable man had brought true news. The
report was all over the town: everybody was talking of
Conway’s death. A woman living in the road called
upon Mrs. Parrot to give her the story, not knowing
that Mrs. Conway was within. Her husband had met
Williamson, the man who found Conway, and had got
the account from him clear of all exaggeration.</p>

<p>It was just this: Williamson was a carpenter, and
was walking to Thorrold Marsh to execute a repairing
job at a house there. He was this side of Hanwitch,
just by the bridge facing Squire Markwell’s place, when
he saw a human hand sticking out of the water. He
peered and saw a man lying on his back, the water half
a foot above his face, showing the drowned figure as
plainly as if it were under glass. Williamson pulls off
his coat, tucks up his shirt-sleeves, catches hold of the
hand, and up comes the body like a cork. The moment
he had the body ashore he knew who it was; left his
bag of tools on the bank, and ran as hard as his legs
would carry him into the town to give the alarm. The
inspector and two constables, and a couple of men with
a stretcher belonging to the Town Hall, start out of the
High Street and are conducted by Williamson to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
body. A crowd gathers about the tail of the procession,
the body is put on the stretcher, covered up, and carried
to the Town Hall in the sight of a multitude large
enough to diffuse the news through the length and
breadth of Hanwitch in ten minutes.</p>

<p>So dead Mr. Conway was, if ever a man was dead
in this world; and now, the woman told Mrs. Parrot,
people were only waiting for the coroner’s inquest, to
learn how he came by his death.</p>

<p>But the verdict, however it might run, would be inconclusive,
since there were no witnesses to show how
Conway fell into the water. But this much was known;
that yesterday Conway had called at the “Three Stars”
and ordered a fine dinner to be got ready for him, with
champagne and the best of wines; and to let the landlord
understand that he meant what he said, he pulled
out a handful of sovereigns and let them fall into his
pocket again, chink! chink! When dinner was done,
he left the house intoxicated, and what became of him
the “Three Stars” didn’t know; but the “Pine Apple”
did, for he came there in the afternoon and squeezed
himself behind the bar, made love to the barmaid, drank
some tumblers of rum, and got into an abusive argument
with an ostler, whose eye he threatened to blacken if he
contradicted him again. On which he was turned out.</p>

<p>That was his day’s history, so far as it was recorded
in human knowledge. The rest could be guessed; and
the public were not slow in explaining their theories.
Of course he was drunk, had rolled into the water, and
was too senseless to get out again, though the water
where he lay was not above two and a half feet deep.</p>

<p>Nobody cared twopence about his death. It gave
the shop-people something to talk about until customers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
dropped in, and then it was, “What’s the next article?”
and Conway was forgotten. When a bubble explodes
upon the surface of a stream, nothing mourns. The tide
rolls on just the same, with sunshine or darkness in its
breast, as the case may be; the pikes lose no jot of their
voracity, and gudgeons swim into their maws; the minnows
jump at the flies. Shall law, commerce, or anything
else stop because a drunkard is drowned? Cover him
up; let him hide his face until the pale jury come to
take a peep; then pop him out of sight in a hole, and
get back as fast as we may to dinner.</p>

<p>But there were two persons on whose destiny this
man’s death was to exercise an influence as wonderful,
and gracious, and beneficial, as though, instead of a dead
drunkard, he was a good spirit&mdash;an angel charged with
a mission of love, sent by God Himself to work out and
complete the happiness of the man who had been heavily
tried, but who, in his bitterest trial, had never been
found wanting.</p>

<p>And I truly think that for such men&mdash;men who in
their sorrow reverentially bow their heads and say,
“God knows, I believe in Him; He shall lead me as a
little child”&mdash;who murmur not, but, praising their
Heavenly Father always, make their actions a profound
heroism by obeying His voice in all seasons, not more
faithfully in moments of joy than in moments of anguish&mdash;for
such men we shall seldom err in prophesying a
time in their lives when the heat of the day shall be
shaded from them, and their burden and their conflict
removed. “O man, greatly beloved, go thou thy way
till the end; for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at
the end of thy days.”</p>

<p>Dolly had asked to be left alone with her child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Deeming Holdsworth a stranger, she had felt the restraint
of his presence upon her, deeply as she was moved by
his goodness. Her heart ached: misery had mastered
her. The mere sense of having found a friend in this
her time of piteous need could not suffice her. More
was imperative: communion with God, communion with
the husband who, she believed, looked down upon her
from Heaven. To no mortal eyes could she lay bare
the exquisite grief that lacerated her heart; and though
she should find no comfort even in the Heaven she
turned to, yet her full and poignant misery demanded
escape in words and tears, and she asked to be left
alone.</p>

<p>Holdsworth entered the room facing his own apartment.
This was Mrs. Parrot’s drawing-room. Here she
had a piano; here she had some wonderful stuffed birds
under glass shades; here she herself sat on Sundays
with her mother, when her house was unoccupied.</p>

<p>He struggled to calm himself, that he might master
and appreciate all the significance of the position in
which he was placed by the sudden death of Conway.
But his moods were wild and hurrying; the play of
emotion was quick and painful. He saw his wife in her
grief; he saw her wrestling, with no eye but her child’s
upon her, with the anguish that filled her; he felt her
loneliness: he felt the cruel hopelessness that weighed
in her heart as lead; he felt, above all, the dreadful
sense of degradation which must attend her reflections
upon the death of her husband, Conway; upon the
wretched, miserable life she had led with him; upon the
complete and bitter reversal of the sole end for which
she had married him.</p>

<p>The barrier that divided them was gone. Could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
there be any scruple now to hold him back from her?
If there yet lingered one feeling of delicacy to prompt
him to delay his confession for a little, until the dead
was buried, until something of the horror of the sudden
death had yielded to time, should it not be removed by
the knowledge of her misery, which he had it in his
power to dissipate and turn to gladness? Why should
she weep? Why should she feel one instant of pain,
when he could change her tears to smiles, her grief to
joy?</p>

<p>He stole to the door of the room she was in and
listened. He heard her sobbing, and that sound vanquished
his last hesitation.</p>

<p>He turned the handle gently and entered. She was
on her knees beside the sofa, her arms twined about
Nelly, her face buried in the child’s lap. She started,
looked at him, and rose slowly to her feet. He approached
and stood before her.</p>

<p>“Will you not trust me as a friend?” he said, in a
voice a little above a whisper.</p>

<p>She tried to answer him, but her sobs choked her
voice. He seated himself and took Nelly on his knee,
and, whilst he smoothed the child’s hair, continued:
“There <i>is</i> hope, there <i>is</i> comfort for you and this little
one. Check your sobs and listen to me. I can give
you comfort, for I have known what it is to lose one
that is dearer to me than my heart’s blood, to lose her
and to find her again. She was my wife, and I left her
to go to sea. The ship I sailed in was wrecked, and
for many days I lay consumed with hunger and thirst
in an open boat, seeing miserable creatures like myself
dying around me one by one. And when I was rescued
my memory was gone; I could not remember my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
name, my home, the wife I had left, the country I had
sailed from. But the voice of God one day directed
me to leave Australia and go to England. I reached
London, and there a man spoke to me of Hanwitch, a
name familiar and dear to me for my wife’s sake. And
when I came to Southbourne, the beloved old village
gave me back my memory. I knew whom I had come
to seek, and what I had lost. They told me that my
wife thought me dead, and was married and lived with
my child here&mdash;in this road&mdash;in that house yonder!
O Dolly! O wife!”</p>

<p>Her sweet sad face, as he continued speaking, had
been slowly upturning to his, and, when their eyes met,
he put the little child upon the floor and stretched out
his arms, crying, “O Dolly! O wife!”</p>

<p>But she!</p>

<p>There was a look of petrifaction, stranger and more
awful even than death, upon her face; her eyes glared,
her lips were parted: and to have seen her thus stirless,
thus white, thus staring, thus breathless, you would
have said that she was dead, even as she sat there.</p>

<p>Then the life leaped into her, she started from the
sofa with a loud hysterical laugh, and flung herself on
her knees before him, crying, “John! John!”</p>

<p>“Dolly!”</p>

<p>“John! John!” she repeated; and she brought his
hand to her eyes, and stared at it; and then grasped
his knees and raised her face to his, talking to herself
in hurried, inaudible whispers, and fixing a piercing
gaze upon him.</p>

<p>“John! John!” she cried out again.</p>

<p>He put his arms around her, and would have pressed
her to his heart, but she kept herself away with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
hand against his breast, preserving that keen, unwinking,
steadfast, wonderful gaze.</p>

<p>“Do you not know me, Dolly?” he cried. “Look at
me closely; hear my voice! hear me tell you of the
old dear times! We were to meet in the summer, do
you remember, Dolly? and we were never more to part;
and you were to keep a calendar and mark off the days.
O God! what weary days&mdash;what endless days to both
of us! And do you remember the walks we took the
day before we parted, down by the river, where I sat
and cried in your arms because the sight of your sorrow
broke me down and I had no more comfort to give you?”</p>

<p>But still she would not let him clasp her. Still she
kept her hand pressed against him, and her eyes, now
growing wild and unreal with fear, upon his face.</p>

<p>“O God!” he cried in his agony. “Will she not
know me? Has my secret come upon her too suddenly?
Darling! darling! I could not see your tears, I could
not hear your sobs, I could not feel the desolation and
misery that was breaking your heart, and still keep myself
hidden from you. Oh, bitter has the trial been to
watch you&mdash;to know you to be mine&mdash;to see my little
child&mdash;and to be as a stranger to you! Call me John!
Call me husband! Speak to me, Dolly! Tell me that
no change that pain and suffering have made in me can
disguise me from your love!”</p>

<p>She released herself from his arms and sprang a yard
away from him; and there, as she stood transfixed,
watching him with large, steady eyes, her dishevelled
hair about her forehead, her hands clenched, and her
head inclined forward, she looked like a marble figure
of madness, her habiliments carven to the life.</p>

<p>She had thought him dead. For many, many months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
she had prayed to him as one in Heaven. Did she
know him now? Yes, but as a dead man might be
known&mdash;with unspeakable fear and unspeakable love;
with the horror of superstition and the passion of deep
affection.</p>

<p>Thus they stood for awhile, their eyes fixed on each
other: then a heavy sigh broke from him; he turned
to his child.</p>

<p>“Nelly, my little one, come to me! I am thy
father!”</p>

<p>He extended his arms. The action and words broke
the spell. With an indescribable cry Dolly fled to him.</p>

<p>“John! John!” she murmured. “My husband&mdash;my
very own! Come back to me from the dead!
Come back to me after all this cruel waiting!”</p>

<p>And then she broke from him again, and watched
him yet again from a distance, then ran and flung her
arms around his neck, crying, “John! John! Why
did you not come to me before? why did you not come
to me before?”</p>

<p>The hot tears were streaming down his cheeks now:
he held her tightly, saying, in broken tones:</p>

<p>“We are together&mdash;never more to part. I am thy
very husband! I have loved thee always! Oh, God
be praised, the merciful God be praised for this!”</p>

<p>“Nelly, Nelly!” she cried; and she ran from him
and seized her child, and held her up.</p>

<p>“She is ours, John! our little one! We have found
papa, Nelly! There he is! There is Nelly’s papa!
God has given him back to us&mdash;we were broken-hearted
just now ... O husband! ... husband!”</p>

<p>She broke down; a dangerous excitement had up to
this moment sustained her. She sank into a weeping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
sobbing, fainting woman in a moment; but his arms
received her, his breast pillowed her, and there she
rested for many minutes, with no sound to break the
holy silence that filled the room but his deep quivering
sobs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When we peep at them again, a half-hour has passed,
and the wife is seated near the husband with her arm
around him; and the child is on her father’s knee. The
fear that threw a film upon the exquisite emotions of
the girl has passed; she is listening to his story, interrupting
him often with quick exclamations of distress, then
fondling him and listening again, vibrating with eagerness,
with love, with amazement, which makes her pale
face kaleidoscopic with expression. He is telling her of
his sufferings in the boat, of his rescue, of his friends in
Australia, of his return to England, of his arrival at
Southbourne; and as she hears him tell the story of his
noble unselfishness&mdash;how, to save her from the sorrow
and the shame that must have attended his disclosure,
if made while Conway lived, he held his secret, but
could not keep his love from going forth to his child&mdash;she
knows that he has brought back to her the same
grand heart he took with him five years ago; the same
magnanimous qualities; the same pure impulses; the
same heroical capacity of self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>And then she tells him her story; and now it is for
him to soothe her with the love that has transformed
his face and made it beautiful with a deeper and subtler
beauty than it had ever before worn. For, as she recurs
to those piteous times of her distress, her tears gush
forth afresh and her eyes grow wild, as though she did
not believe in the happiness that had come to her at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>I see them sitting in that room while the bright
morning sunshine pours upon the window and floods
the floor with its radiance; I hear the birds singing
merrily in the garden, and the cosy chucking of the
hens and the sound of the fresh sweet wind as it sweeps
through the pear-trees and sends the red-edged leaves
rustling to the ground.</p>

<p>I see the child’s large deep eyes wandering from
father to mother, from mother to father, with the small
face busy with the unformed consciousness that struggles
in it.</p>

<p>I see the mother careworn and pale, but with the
light of rapture on her face that discloses all its secret
sweetness, watching, ever watching, with soft eyes
shining with happy tears, the dear one whose arm is
around her.</p>

<p>I see Holdsworth with the patches of gray upon his
hair, his sunken cheeks and bowed figure symbolising
while his life shall hold the unspeakable sufferings of
mind and body he has known since we first beheld him.
I see him, with the calmness of perfect joy mellowing
his eyes, and enriching his face with a colour that owes
its lustre to the spirit, so that it shall be there in darkness
and in sunshine, holding his wife to his heart, often
pressing his lips to his child, often glancing upwards
with looks of ineffable gratitude; and I think of those
two lines which Goldsmith says are worth a million:</p>

<p>“<i>I have been young, and now am old: yet never saw
I the righteous man forsaken, nor his seed begging their
bread.</i>”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A knock falls upon the door; the door is opened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
and enter Mrs. Parrot. Does she start dramatically?
I promise you there is more genuine astonishment conveyed
by the little jump she gives, as she falls back a
step and then stands staring, than in any movement
designed to express wonderment you will see performed
on the stage.</p>

<p>So the mystery is solved, is it? So her lodger isn’t
a gentleman after all, but an insidious man who, under
pretence of liking Nelly’s company, has been paying
attention to mamma! and now, with Conway’s body
lying in the Town Hall, dead only a few hours, is
actually caressing the widow in Mrs. Parrot’s respectable
house!</p>

<p>Holdsworth and Dolly exchange glances, and Dolly
hangs her head with a look of confusion on her face
(and well she may, thinks Mrs. Parrot) as Holdsworth
puts Nelly down and rises.</p>

<p>“I am really sorry to introod,” says Mrs. Parrot
haughtily, “but my motive for knockin’, sir, was to
inquire when you would like your breakfast sarved?”</p>

<p>“We’ll talk of that in a moment,” answers Holdsworth.
“I have something to say to you. This lady
is my wife!”</p>

<p>“I beg your parding,” says Mrs. Parrot, growing
very pale.</p>

<p>“My wife, Mrs. Parrot. You have heard of Mr.
Holdsworth who went to sea and was drowned? He
was not drowned. I am Mr. Holdsworth!”</p>

<p>“You!”</p>

<p>She tottered, ran forward, grasped the table, and
shrieked, “You!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Parrot,” exclaimed Dolly, “this is John&mdash;my
own darling husband, who I thought was dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>“And do you mean to say, sir,” gasped Mrs. Parrot
hysterically, “that you knew who you was yourself all
the time?”</p>

<p>“All the time that I have lodged with you.”</p>

<p>“An’ you’ve seen your lawful wife day arter day
without speakin’ of it, or sayin’ who you was?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Because,” stammered Mrs. Parrot, still clinging to
the table, “because you says that a wife can’t have two
husbands, and so you hid yourself that you might spare
her feelin’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is why, Mrs. Parrot,” cried Dolly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Parrot took a deep breath, and then, to the
amazement of the others, burst into tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, I can’t help it,” she sobbed. “I niver did
hear in all my life of such beautiful conduct. Niver ..
And is this your child?... Why, of course it is! Oh
dear! who’d ha’ thought that any mortal man could ha’
acted so nobly! Oh, sir, let me shake your hand.”</p>

<p>She not only shook his hand, but actually fell against
him and kissed him; and then, overwhelmed with her
effrontery and her feelings, was rushing out of the room,
when Holdsworth stopped her.</p>

<p>“One moment, dear Mrs. Parrot. You are the only
person in Hanwitch&mdash;in the world I may say&mdash;who
knows our secret. Will you keep it? We have many
reasons for not wishing it known.”</p>

<p>“I will, sir, I promise you,” blubbered the honest
woman, “since you ask me; but if it wasn’t for that
I’d go and spread the noos everywhere, I would, for I
niver heerd of such beautiful conduct before, niver, in
sarmons or anywheers else; and it ’ud be the makin’
of many a man to be told of it. God bless you both,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
I’m sure. God bless you, little gal. You’ve found a
good father&mdash;a rare good father!”</p>

<p>And out she ran choking.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So the curtain falls, for the end has come. No need
to raise it again, for you who have sat so kindly and
patiently through this little drama must know as well
as I what will become of the two chief characters and
their little one when they have made their bow and
withdrawn. Australia is before them, with generous
friends to welcome them to their new home, and listen
with interest and tenderness to their strange story of
bitter separation, and sweet and sacred reunion.</p>

<p>Enough has been written; the quill that has driven
these creations to this point is but a stump; the hand
that holds it is tired; the companionship of the shadows
which have kept me company is broken. What fitter
time, then, than now to say good-bye?</p>

</div>

<p>I must claim the reader’s indulgence while I speak for
a moment of that portion of the foregoing narrative which
refers to the hero’s loss of memory.</p>

<p>That loss of memory has been brought about by
trials and sufferings such as I have attempted to depict
in the early chapters of this narrative, is too certain to
make it necessary that I should adduce instances (which
are very readily procured) as proof. That such loss has
lasted, not for months only, but for years, will be seen
by the following anecdote, which suggested this story,
and which I extract from the <i>Noon Gazette</i> of July,
<span class="lock">1772:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Last Sunday died at Winchelsea a character of whom
a correspondent, a gentleman distinguished both by his
parts and benevolence, has obligingly furnished us with
the following account: That his name was <i>William
Stephens</i>, and that he was a mariner, who, many years
since, was pressed from his home to serve on board His
Majesty’s ship of war <i>The Vapour</i>; that he was then
married but two weeks; that whilst cruising off the
Portugal coast <i>The Vapour</i> was wrecked, and <i>Stephens</i>,
with some others, saved his life by clinging to a portion
of the wreck, in which condition they languished near
three days, and were then rescued by a French merchant-man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
who carried them into <i>Bordeau</i> (<i>sic</i>): that on
<i>Stephens</i> being questioned, he was found to have lost
his memory, on which he was sent into England, and
was hired as porter by <i>Mr. Hudson</i>, of the <i>York Inn</i>, in
or near to <i>Folkestone</i>, in <i>Kent</i>, where he remained for two
years in entire ignorance of his past, until, his memory
returning, he set off for Winchelsea on foot, and arrived
to find his wife married to one <i>Eel</i>, a cobbler, whose life
Stephens threatened if he did not restore him his <i>Nancy</i>.
This the cobbler did, and so the matter ended. It occasioned
much gossip, and to the end of his days Mr.
Stephens (who settled down as a carpenter, having lost
all relish for the sea) was regarded with curiosity, and
had to the houses of the neighbouring gentry, whom his
singular story never failed to divert.”</p>

<p>There are on record many instances of loss of memory,
occasioned by various means. In some cases the deprivation
has been complete, and the restoration sudden, and
resembling an abrupt revelation. In other instances it
has been accompanied by faint, glimmering, haunting
reminiscences, creating indescribable anxiety, but growing
up suddenly into a sound and permanent recovery.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
